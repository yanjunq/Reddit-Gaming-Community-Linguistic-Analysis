Something I found in recent games I played,"As an enthusiastic online strategy games lover over the years, I feel that most of them are quite similar. Based on a medieval worldview, constantly develop themselves and then fight against the enemy. In fact, the differences are very small. On the contrary, it is the gameplay details that can better reflect the different and bring some fun.

Era of Conquest - offer a difference in mechanics for the player such as resource reduction to slow down players progression, allowing more skill customizability.

Age of titans - With a cosmetic setup of Anime Artstyle, the tutorial and story is both intertwined to allow the new game experience for a new player to be entertaining

Call of Dragons - You can not only attack enemy's city but also allow to attack alliance flags. When you successfully attack alliance flags they will start burning and lose durability, the burning fire can spread and help you against enemy troops.

Here are some details I found when I played these games and I'd love to here your thoughts.",62,180daj6,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/180daj6/something_i_found_in_recent_games_i_played/,5,2023-11-21 09:38:14,Dismal_Work6281,True,False,False,0.98,62,0

What is IdleRune? It is a dynamic Idle & AFK Incremental Game inspired by Old RuneScape! (As a 2D MMORPG),"I made a post on here the other day about my game IdleRune, with a slapped together not much info-packed post! It really took off and I'm here to thank you all, We have made some amazing updates and will continue to, so here's what our near future plans are, including some info on updates completed recently:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t2lw8akjhfyb1.png?width=2109&format=png&auto=webp&s=a58f94d99a2f66d3bc987a9fbf44f5c5c5d2c7ad

Skilling & Combat System:

Our dynamic systems for idling ingame is not going to be implemented until a full RPG framework/engine is finished, BUT, we have implemented a lot regarding these systems.

Skilling in any form has a full on modular system, similar to that of Runescape, where each skill has a formula and unique method for gaining XP, levelling up in each skill incrementally unlocks rewards, faster XP rates & more, of course, just like Runescape, it gets slower as you level up! a big old grind!

Combat is almost fully integrated, Players & enemies together feature a system that works in synergy,Players have Combat stats (Att,Str,Def,HP,Mage,Range), each effect various conditions during combat, including Accuracy, max hit & toughness etc, the system is relatively complex over the usual 2D RPG hack and slash or basic combat, The enemies also use this same system.A player's accuracy will roll off their defence toughness, max hit, armour stats etc, We are very proud of the system!

Our Skilling system is fully integrated and we are now implementing skills one by one, our latest video on youtube shows off the levelling system as an example! (idlerune)

The plans for the game are to release a combat beta, playable by all, hopefully in a week or so more of dev time. (hopefully not famously delayed like OSRS' winter 2017 mobile release)

The Combat beta playtest will feature:

combat skill levelling of All Individual combat skills.

Unlocking of weapons, armour, weapon variants.

Fully implemented NPC's with Animations, Attack animations, Drop Loot tables & more.

A basic Quest system with a quest or two with rewards for completing in XP and Loot form.

Clue Scrolls (basic, but will reward with loot)

A Dragon mini-boss with Switching attack styles, The player will need to be levelled and geared adequately, or mechanics will need to be harnessed in order to successfully kill him!

We will shoutout and give custom ""dragon-killer"" ranks in the discord to players that successfully kill the dragon, as well as a dragon-related cosmetic in the future of the game. As well as rewards and congratulations related to the First dragon kill, the lowest level dragon kill, fastest dragon kill & fastest Combat demo speedrun, We aim to have these stats readily available as the game as a beta is online-enabled, so we store data serverside.

Will you playtest IdleRune during the Combat Beta?

Bomb Finger Review [New Release],"**Game Title:** Bomb Finger

**Platforms:** 

\- iOS

\- Android

**Developer:** BPU Games

**My Review:** Saw this had just released on another Reddit forum and had to see if anyone remembers because it gave me such nostalgia from the old game Dactyl we played on our iPod Touches, so I had to download. When it comes to casual arcade games this is exactly what I look for: simple, no need for a how-to play, a bit addicting, not slammed with ads. 100% worth a download.

&#x200B;

\- **Graphics: 9/10** \- Mix of Modern and 8-bit , visually pleasing

\- **Music: 8/10** \- Sticks in your head haha not annoying though to say the least

\- **Sound FX: 7/10** \- not much of a change, kind of how Flappy Bird was repetitive 

\- **Game Play: 10/10** \- simple solid phone app

\- **Addictiveness: 8/10** \- best when you have someone to compete with

\- **Happiness: 12/10 -** hopefully it brings some nostalgia back to you old heads 

**Overall: 9/10**

&#x200B;

**Game Modes**:

\- **Classic** \- one shot, one oppurtunity lol

\- **3 Lives** \- 3 lives before game over

\- **Hell mode** \- global leaderboard

&#x200B;

**Personal High Score:** 168

**Download links:**

**iOS :** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bomb-finger/id6478815689](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bomb-finger/id6478815689)

&#x200B;

**Closing thoughts:**

First of many phone game reviews so take it easy on me this time and show the love. Overall im bias it got my heartstrings and the name Bomb Finger is hilarious.  Excited to see if yall enjoy it or can beat my high score because i think IM HIM with 168 haha",16,1be85h4,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/1be85h4/bomb_finger_review_new_release/,2,2024-03-14 00:45:40,Boat-New491,True,False,False,0.94,16,0

What I have been working on the past 2 weeks. Game Update.,"Since i got such a  great reponse and feedback from my last post, i wanted to provide some updates on what i have been working on for the past 2 weeks. Photos are a key component of the story of the game, so i have upgraded the visuals from the original mockups to illustrstions. The player will collect photos throughout the different levels to have a final storybook. 

I also want to show the new dialogue system i have implemented.  I have blurred the text just not to spoil anything when the game gets released.

Thank you guys for all your support. I have also launched this on kickstarter to get some additional funds to help me push through the last phase of development. Note that tier 3 backers will get their name in the credits of the game.

I absolutely HAAAAAATE these stupid ass ads,"Dear mobile game developers (that make these absolutely horrendous ads)
I just want to take a moment to express my hatred towards you. 

Out of spite, due to how insufferable these ads are, I will never download these games.

I don't get it, I guess it's workings for you, and I genuinely hate that. Truly. I don't expect to ""make a difference"" by posting this, you just frustrate me so much that I feel the need to post this. I'm at the point now that I would rather just close whatever app I'm on when I see these ads and re-open it than even THINK about tapping that add. 

I miss the golden age of mobile games, you money generators have ruined it for me. I hate you, I hate you so much. I hate you.

How much is too much for ads,"Hey there,

So, let's talk about ads in mobile games. I'm stepping into the game dev world myself and wanted to pick your brains on this.

Here's what I'm curious about:

1. **Do you ever pay to remove ads in mobile games, or do you simply uninstall the game?** I'm interested in understanding the user perspective and how ads impact your gaming experience.
2. **As gamers, where do you draw the line between tolerable and excessive ad presence?** It's a delicate balance, and I'm keen to learn what makes ads more acceptable in your eyes.

For me, it's a bit of a peculiar situation. As a solo developer, I recently integrated ads into my first mobile game. It's a way for me to fund my journey as I work towards creating my dream game.

In need of a mobile game I can pop in and out of quickly,"Hey people,

My boss just ordered a mandatory return to the office after 3 years of blissful and relaxing work from home... I loved not listening to office drama and having people breathe down my neck because of ""maximal productivity"".

I usually finish all my work in 3 to 4 hours. By working from home I was able to do something productive with myself. Now I will be forced to sit in the office, pretending to work most of the time because our managers are control freaks.

I'm in dire need of some good mobile games. They need to be easy to pop in and out of because our managers patrol around like sergeants, watching us like hawks.

So far, the best I found is the Kingdom Rush games and Winked: Episodes of Romance. I can easily pause them when I see managers snooping around.

My own impression: the graphics are very good, but with this size of the game (about 3 GB), it could be better.  In general, the game personally attracted me and so far only hooked me with the actual theme - I really like the works of the respected J. Tolkien.

My job is very boring and I need something to pass the time," Hey guys,

I started working as a security guard in a park in my city which is really peaceful and nothing ever happens. Because of that, my job is 90% downtime with absolutely nothing but my phone to keep me sane.

I'm not a big mobile gamer myself because all the gaming I ever did was mostly on my PC. Unfortunately, I can't bring it with me so I have decided to branch out and see what being a mobile gamer is like.

When I did do a little gaming on my phone it was, for the most part, casual click or swipe games. The only ones I know are Fruit Ninja, Subway Surfers, and Temple Run. I did, however, run into a cute little game called Pop Them. It is really simple and effective in passing time because all you do is match colors to make the best end result. It's very satisfying to see all the colors line up and explode. 

I've been playing that for the most part and will soon reach the end of the currently available content. Never been that big of a fan of these kinds of games except for Pop Them which got me addicted, but I’m open to exploring any options. So, please recommend as many as you can because Pop Them has been a true savior at this mind-numbing job.",11,139xhb9,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/139xhb9/my_job_is_very_boring_and_i_need_something_to/,28,2023-05-06 18:10:06,OneHamster1337,True,False,False,1.0,11,0

My idea for a movie or series based on the mobile game Vector,"I was having some daydreams and I have some ideas for pop culture productions like fancasts. And I don't know, I think the game Mobile Vector would make a good movie or series. In case you didn't know, the game has a story, cutscenes and a well-defined artistic style and so on. Roughly speaking, the story seems to take place in a futuristic scenario of mind control and work, like a matrix and the characters escape from it, in Vector 2 they are victims of a kind of cloning. I don't know, I think it would be cool if Nekki collaborated with a production company like Netflix and produced a movie of the game. It could be live action or animated, and between a movie or a series, I'd prefer a movie because unlike most games that have a story too long to be told in a movie, they prefer a series, I think Vector is the opposite and has little source material so a movie would be more appropriate. I was thinking of the actor Aidan Turner to play the lead role",12,17npgh9,MobileGaming,https://i.redd.it/s6i9nhh6zcyb1.jpg,4,2023-11-04 16:34:09,AgentSilly9137,False,False,False,1.0,12,0

I tried Dragon Village Collection,"Okay, so the game just came out globally a month or so ago.  
It is free-to-download, pay-for-premium items type of game that mixes gacha and tamagochi game play.  
The main mission in this game is to collect the rearmost dragons, and it's quite fun. The game has a very frindly english speaking community and an English Wiki that is being updated with each update and small hotfixes.  
Also I want to highlight that information provided by wiki or other player very important in this game.

I am not a huge fan of stories, especially in mobile games. But here what I understood.  
The premise is that you are some kind of ""Pokemon Trainer"" who searching for dragon eggs during his world explorations.  
The main thing, as I understood, is to breed a super rare dragon and trade it with other players.  
Also I found that there are some users selling cards with rare dragons which you can not find in game.  
The fun playing this game is evolving dragons, grinding for powerful items, and crushing noobs at Colosseum.

About the Dragons  
The elements don't seem to mean anything in terms of strength and weakness and really only loosely apply to the name and appearance of the dragons. They only really serve as a way to sort and catalog them in dragon book, which you will be attempting to complete.

If you going to try this, I suggest you to join the official Discord to get some tips from veteran players:  
[\[Discord\]](https://discord.com/invite/dvc)

If you are not ready to socialize with other people, just like me.  
You can just enter wiki and get all from there:

Is ther anny good games out there,"So this is subjective I know. But realy. I've been looking for a good mobile game for a while now, and all I find is garbage. I don't mind paying for gaming, I don't even mind micro transactions to a degree. But when they force feed you ""offers"" every five seconds and ther is a button everywhere to ""improve"" things using som diamonds you have to buy, then I'm out. 

And also when the game holds your hand all the game to such a degree that all you are doing is pushing the buttons the game tels you to then no thank you. I want a chalange I want freedom. 

Wy can't we have something like age og empires for mobile. Souldt that be possible today? Phones today have more prosesing power than 20 year old computer so why are we stuck with a endless stream of shitt? 

And yes ther is a few exceptions out there. Stardew wally being one of them, it's a great game. Also recently tried a towerdefence game that's called Kingdom Rush that's good fun and a chalange. 

But for every good game there is a million bad ones. So does anyone have any great mobile games to share?

"Where are the ""real"" mobile games?","So I'm gonna try to explain this as best as possible lol... I apologize if this sounds stupid lmao.

Y'all ever see an ad for a mobile game in the Play Store that looks super interesting or fun, but the reviews are awful and the game is littered with ads?

I seem to find the ""real"" (no/minimal ads, more features, less play-to-win) game later on after browsing through four or five different-but-similar apps and seeing millions of downloads, yet the reviews are negative.
Even the pictures previewing the game on all these games are all similar graphics, characters, etc.


I guess the best example I can think of at tgis time is ""Revenge of the Queen"" compared to ""Fate of the Empress"" (and all the other copycat apps like those two).

Or similar to that of those match-three games or merge games, and like games such as Clash of Clans.

Mobile gaming setup total cost was only $157 😳,"I bought a motorola moto g stylus 5g 2022 version at 57% off on Amazon and a Razor kishi V1 for $50 to create my first mobile gaming setup. Ok...

This phone comes with a Snapdragon 695 5G which so far has allowed me to play psp games at 4x resolution and most likely can go higher with some tweaks. The Razor kishi V1 is apparently better egornomically than it's successor but doesn't provide the acces to the Razor Nexus app for further customization and mapping so keep that in mind if you want to the newest software that Razor provides. With that being said, if you're looking for a entry level mobile gaming hurry and find this phone on sale before the prices go up again.

Looking for a game,"There was this game that perhaps in 2017-2018 (? Im not great at remember time) i used to play and it was like a mix of Minecraft, Growtopia and Terraria and it was multiplayer and had multiple servers. There was a night and day cycle, there were trees and bushes that would grow, there was crafting, mining and all that, and the water looked awesome with the graphics. There was a swimming animation. There were shadows and all. It all had this god-like atmosphere, even the music was heavenly. I remember that it had a very small audience, there were a few people. There was even PvP but i think you could turn it off. I will provide a sketch. I know it wont give much but good lord I'll do anything to find this game again. This is all i can remember.

Sick of monetized games being the same exact game,"They all have alliances and are mini versions of EVE Online that have us advancing by stealing from each other.

The events all require alliance participation. 

The gameplay never matches the advertised promotion animations. 

They are all: build base, improve heroes, train troops, gather and fight for resources 

I’m not interested in having to work with others in order to succeed / advance / keep the progress I make. In fact, I don’t want to talk to anyone. I damn sure don’t want to be held to some alliance timetable of activity.

I don’t begrudge software companies for their wish to make money, pay bills, etc..  I just don’t like downloading and playing one game after another that turns out to be the exact same game. 

I dunno if there is a white label basic game that all these micro transaction games are built onto…or if the concept is everywhere because this is such an effective cash grab that everyone wants to get in on the action.

Either way - mobile gaming is a cesspool of uniformity, disappointment and dreck.

"Would you play ""traditional"" games made for mobile?","What I mean ""traditional"" in this context (because it sure can mean anything) is stuff like Zelda, Metroid, Pokemon, DQ/FF and that those games are primarily meant for mobile and are not just a port (like Genshin Impact or DeadCells).

Reason why I ask is because Im starting to get into gamedev and I was having a conversation with my best bud (we are both 30 yo) he said ""I just wish my cellphone could be like my old GameBoy"" and that totally stuck with me. I really want to make cool games for mobile, but no cashgrabs, no gacha, no in-app purchases, no season passes, no idle, but plain old fun: games with fun mechanics and a good story that has an ending.

So I wanted to ask you guys how do you feel about that? Would you like to play games like Tunic, Hollow Knight, and Shovel Knight but meant for mobile from the beginning? Games which input controls are carefully designed specifically for a great mobile experience and not a port from keyboard or gamepad

Hi Everyone! I've been waiting for Backbone to release a controller for the iPad. In the meantime I started looking for ways to mount my Joycons to my iPad to play games, and what I found was a little disappointing.

It was around 2013-2015 when my sister and I would constantly play Star Girl. The goal of the game was to buy outfits, get famous, and get boyfriends. There was part of the game that I remember every once in a while that doesn't sit right with me. It was a chat option, where you could talk to your boyfriends and potential boyfriends and I shit you not they would sext you and cuss.  At the time I was young and with my friends. Of course, we were confused, but we didnt know better. (The boyfriends were supposed to be NCPs) Plus Star Girl was targeted at a young audience. Im not sure what's going on with it now, but I know it's not on the app store and when I search up anything about the whole sexting thing, nothing comes up. If this isn't the right place to post this, tell me a better thread to post this on. Im just really curious about this.

I was wondering if anyone here could possibly help me find a game i used to play on one of my old phones not any more than about four years ago. I'm unsure if its on **both** the Google play store and the Apple play store but i hope someone could help me find it since ive tried on my own and couldn't, and can't remember the name.

It was a mobile game similar to how Call of Duty zombies works, but it was with robots, it had a similar point system, it had guns on the walls you could buy, perk machines, doors you had to buy to open, robots in place of zombies. You could play online with other people, the aesthetic of the game was very clean unlike zombies where there's always blood everywhere (if that helps). Also if i remember correctly the player models were just floating orbs with hands to hold the guns.

I really hope someone could help me find this game since ive been looking for it for a while and havent tried to ask for help here yet. It was really fun so i hope if it gets found then this post helps others find this very fun game.

What are your favorite free iPhone games?,"Hi! I’m looking for free iPhone games that will absorb my attention and eat up hours of time, and I’d love to hear what some of your favorites are. Any genre works, as long as it is an amazing game. 

I prefer 3D games, with the exception being resource management games such as War and Peace, Whiteout Survival, and Rise of Empires. I am a huge fan of exploration, resource collection, and crafting. In the past, I’ve enjoyed open world games like Undawn, Genshin Impact, and Tower of Fantasy. I hate auto-play, and generally don’t like first person games. I’d also prefer games that aren’t too violent.

What games made you change your mind about specific genres?,"It's normal for gamers to have preferences about genres. Some of us love MMO games because of the endless grind and the social element, some love strategies because they occupy our minds the best, and some of us have absolutely 0 taste and somehow find gacha games to be the best mobile gaming has to offer.

Nevertheless, all of us have had an epiphany moment in our after playing a certain game, a moment in which we realized that maybe that genre we hated so much isn't that awful. For me, a moment like that happened on PC after playing Hades for the first time. I absolutely hated Roguelikes because I considered them to be ""more scarce ARPG without depth"", but this game changed my outlook on that.

However, for mobile games, that actually happened not once, but 4 times. The only games I considered ""worth"" of trying out were strategy games back in the day, but as I slowly started getting deeper into mobile gaming, my horizons expanded. These games changed the way I perceived certain genres:

**Random Dice** ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.percent.royaldice&hl=en_US&gl=US) | [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/random-dice-defense/id1462877149)) - I'd never been into this type of game on mobile because I felt like they were too complex for a device that paled in comparison to PC. Random Dice changed that and showed me that tower defense/card games can be played on mobile too.

**Albion Online** ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.albiononline&hl=en_US&gl=US) | [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albion-online/id1202788573)) - MMOs for mobile are usually some shady, scammy, invasive money-loundering schemes in which microtransactions are pushed down your throat at every corner. Well, not with Albion Online, it's a full-fledged MMO game without any invasive microtransactions.

**Pop Them** ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tummygames.popthem&hl=en) | [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pop-them-emoji-puzzle-game/id6444124612)) - As a person who's chosen to devote his gaming life to deep, complex games, hypercasual mobile titles had been a nightmare come true. That was until I discovered Pop Them and realized that, hey, I do have so much idle time during my day that can be spent doing something fun. I mean, doing my business in the toilet, having my first-morning coffee, or simply waiting in line at a traffic light could all be enhanced and made into fun activities by hypercasual games. Pop Them is my favorite one to date because it served as my gateway to this genre, and I'll probably always have a soft spot for it.

**Vampire Survivors** ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poncle.vampiresurvivors&hl=en_US&gl=US) | [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/vampire-survivors/id6444525702)) - I'd be a liar if I said I haven't seen ads for this type of mobile game long before I came across Vampire Survivors. That's probably why I'd grown to be so engrossed by them - when you're forced to watch similar games with different aesthetics time after time again, they just leave a stale taste in your mouth. However, Vampire Survivors proved to be a gem in a puddle of mud, and the only game of this genre that I've never stopped playing.

This post is probably too long to read even now, so I'll make a full stop.

My first game project : Idle Beast Hunter,"Hi everyone ! Haven't posted news last two weeks, wanted the game to be release ready before next post, and here it is !  


First a few screenshots :

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Short summary of gameplay/content :

\- Auto hack&slash, level up your stats  


\- Harvest (the rebirth system), offline progress up to 80% max stage,  


\- Challenge, where you obtain randomly generated gear (helmet torso gloves boots weapon),  


\- Cavern : Explore rooms in a 20x20 grid (20 moves a day, +10 per ad, max 2 ads) there you can obtain relics and companion summon stones (10/week). The layout is shared between all players, so teamwork is needed to find all the good rooms and avoid the traps !  


\- Companions : will assist you in battle (Auto Skilling or manual skilling). The first update after release will introduce a Gacha.  


I remade the user interface, and added a ton of QoL to the game (gear menu / cave menu...) I can't wait to hear some feedback :D !  


What is missing for release :

1) Add daily limits for dungeon + cave (still unlimited for testing)

2) Add some anti cheat on the server when saving data (should be easy)

3) Add IAP to the game (2.99 no ad, 1.99 skins is what I think is fair), and even without no ad, you won't be annoyed with ads everywhere, ill limit it to 1/2 daily on the challenge, and 1/2 in the cave, that's it !

4) Add (?) buttons for mini tutorials in each menu,  


And then prepare the store pages :)  
Since it is my very first project I am unsure how long this will take me, but I hope 2 weeks maximum, if I get enough time to work on the project ! (Baby please let me work a little haha :D)  


The test versions (TestFlight // APK, didn't manage to get the play store alpha to work x\_x sorry for anyone who was waiting for that and didn't want to install an apk) are as usual on my itch : [https://mksidev.itch.io/idle-beast-hunter](https://mksidev.itch.io/idle-beast-hunter)   
There is also a link to the discord where I discuss the game daily and implement players feedback live ! I really want to base the games future updates on players recommendations, as I have done until now with all suggestions :)  


Thank you guys so much for testing, this community has helped me alot !  


Have a great weekend,

It was a bit of a “point-and-click” gameplay, with a pixel-style.

With the clues thats found, eventually leads to a prisoner named Gregory Gant, that was struck by lightning during a escape attempt and died, but after doing some investigation at the prison, the game was made to cut off, requiring purchase to the rest of the content, which i never paid for.

It’s been a long time…,"Hey guys,

I, like many others have completely written off mobile gaming for a long, long time.

I’ve found the games to always have a little bit of promise to be quickly stricken down with shady businesses practices or money grabbing, overly confusing currency’s.

I recently upgraded my handset to an iPhone 15 Pro max. This led me down a rabbit hole of learning apple *seems* to be at least acknowledging that games exist on mobile.

So I’ve been aware of things like PUBG, COD mobile e.c.t for a while and I’ve dipped my toe from time to time in the big hits that come out. 

I just want to know what are the good games that don’t feel like I need to pay to win, that are just a good time and don’t have adds for there battle pass every 20seconds.

It looks like there’s a lot of great games in the pipeline for mobile, warframe, warzone & the division to name a couple.

Advise me on a new game please,"Hi there,
Im on the lookout for a casual game or 2 for my android. Im going to be annoyingly thorough.

 Im mostly looking for another game like Fallout Shelter. I have my 3 vaults established and find myself wishing i could have a few more lol. I just like organizing the vault and managing the little dudes with low risk of losing progress & low investment of time or money. Ill list why I like it so maybe someone knows a game that isnt formatted exactly the same but has these traits. my google for ""games like fallout shelter"" yielded nothing. it doesnt need to be apocalypse themed. 

-single player
-offline
-no severe penalty for neglecting it for day or 2
-free to play (okay with few buck one time charge if it also comes with no/way less ads)
-no ads unless you want a boon of some kind (I never purchase nuka or lunch boxes & it doesnt bother me that ad rewards are limited id rather wait a day for lil guys to trudge back gome than pay to get em back sooner)
-little dudes to care for (i enjoy just naming them)
-simple to manage. some days i just load up to tap resources then close some days i dont even open it.
-the quests arent narrative heavy

Murder By Choice is probably the worst whodunit game in existence,"This game is frustratingly predictable and slow. It adds unnecessary drama while giving everything away in the first parts. Not to mention that you spend an awful lot of energy per action, which disables the player to finish the game in a short amount of time. 

Don't get me started on the dialogue! I mean, if you have enough resource (Nordcurrent is a pretty successful developer), you might as well spend some of your dime into storytelling and maybe hiring better voice actors.

Introducing My First Game - AI Tower: A New Roguelike/lite Tower Defense Game,"I've been developing my first game, a roguelike/lite tower defense game called AI Tower, and I'm happy to say it's ready for you to play. AI Tower takes its cues from titles like The Tower and Lone Tower, blending strategy with the laid-back but addictively fun playstyle of idle games.

Why might you like it?

* It’s easy to pick up but offers a growing challenge.
* The strategy is key – which tower upgrades will you choose?
* Your tower becomes more powerful over time with permanent upgrades.
* Levels become increasingly difficult, offering a real sense of achievement as you progress.
* Face menacing AI enemies such as a knife-wielding Roomba, and irate vending machines.

To celebrate the game's release, here are a couple of bonus codes for bonus currency:

    ROBOCALYPSE
    PLUGANDPRAY

Redeem them in the options menu and get a head start.

What's the best reccomended touch sampling rate for serious competitive mobile gaming?,"I'm really into competitive gaming, and lately my phone has been really lacking alot considering it only has a max of 180hz tsr, I've been planning on getting the Poco F5 Pro since it looks like it gives the best value for its current affordable price range which also has 480hz tsr, I did some research and I found out that the best reccomended is 480hz tsr and upwards, I really need some thoughts from people experienced with mobile gaming especially the technical side, what is the best tsr for really fast paced competitive games like CoD:M, Farlight 84 and Genshin Impact? Will 480hz tsr be more than enough for hard competitive gaming? If not, give me a range of tsr that's very optimal for my condition, Thanks!

As your progressed to the right there were building that acted as shops I think. You got coins and could continue to expand to the right with them as well as purchase better defenses I think.

"Free and Offline games that are addictive time killers, be it tower defense games, puzzles, word games, etc. Just something you can jump into right away.","Hi, I have long stretches of time where I'm just sitting around waiting during night shift type of work. But with limited data and no wifi, I'm looking for free offline games that are addicting and challenging, ones I can just jump into and get absorbed, not noticing the time go by. Like now I was playing Kingdom Rush, which I had played a long time ago and so it's fresh for me again. It's amazing how much of a time killer it is. But I'm almost done with the game, so need other options.

At times I've also found myself kind of losing time while playing puzzles or word type games like Wordle or Bookworm or similar games. I tried escape the room type puzzle games but they stressed me out, madly tapping all over the small iphone screen, so those are a no go.

Some strategy games are fine too but others seem just too complicated and require learning a lot of stuff just to play it and I don't have the patience. I want to just jump into it whenever without doing a lot of reading and thinking.

Btw I have an old iphone and and an older android phone so games on either are fine though I prefer iphone because the latter seems to be dying.

Looking for an in-depth mmo/online game and other hidden gems.,"Hi! 

I recently got into MHN and it made me realise that not all mobile games are complete trash lol

What games are you playing that fit the below criteria?

I have spent quite a bit of time endlessly browsing google play and the app store:


- online/mmo/strong community/lots of players and seasonal events etc.

- f2p/premium but not p2w (Happy to pay $10-15ish per month on some sort of pass but endless $2 top ups is not for me. I dont care if the top 5% of players are paying to win as long as I can play with others that are a bit more casual)

- able to play for 5 mins while waiting for a train on phone or long sessions on ipad/pc without constantly having to top up paid upgrades like potions etc. Bonus points if its a ""real"" game on steam that you can also play on mobile.

- preferably cross platform but at least cross between android and ios. (working with an android phone, ipad pro and a gaming pc)

- online with a community you can talk to/team up with (located in oceania, seems like japan have lots of populated mmo type games that you cant get in my territory)

- genre: MMO/MMORPG/MMO Strategy - Theme doesnt matter. something that isn't a classic WOW style mmo where I have to control a character in landscape view at least not at all times anyway. I'd like a game where I can check up on progress/set upgrades like EVE online but also enjoy playing with people directly. eg. In wow how you have the main game but with lots of tacked on extra ways to kill time lol

- monster collecting/card/base building/management + some active head to head PVP or PVE elements where you need to be more active/use real time skill.


So far I have noticed that clash of clans, shadowverse, genshin impact and Hearthstone are the main titles on the stores but I have a feeling im missing the good games because i haven't paid any attention to mobile gaming since 2012.

I am probably asking for too much but the stupid graphical style of every game looking identical on the app store is killing me. Please fill me in! Tell me whats quality and in-depth. Seems like i'm asking for a strategy + gacha + mmo type title.

 TL;DR Looking for a meaty mmo/long term game for android/IOS that has lots of ways to play and kill time/build up your character/account with an active community that is paid/high quality. A good example of what I'm after is FFXIV Where the main quest line is something you can play on weekends but you can also visit the casino/play cards if you have 15 mins to kill, it doesn't have to be a classic mmorpg.",4,16wqe1l,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/16wqe1l/looking_for_an_indepth_mmoonline_game_and_other/,2,2023-10-01 03:25:27,Ruggada,True,False,False,0.84,4,0

Medieval/Magic game.,"I can’t remember the name of the game. These are hints

- A single-player game. 
- The game is set in a medieval/magical.
- Each stage has a set mission. 
- You can build buildings and destroy your opponent's (monsters) home base. 
- There are units like warriors/archers/mages. 
- Each unit is not directly controlled by the player, but each unit scouts and fights on its own. 
- Each unit can change jobs as it gains experience, which is also not controlled by the player. For example) Mage > Healer
- You have a tax collector who travels around the building collecting money. If the collector is killed by a monster, no money is collected.",6,15py6ra,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/15py6ra/medievalmagic_game/,1,2023-08-13 12:54:46,flutterrrr,True,False,False,1.0,6,0

Looking for an older (early 2010's) fighter jet game,"I used this game on an ipad in the early 2010's. I will list some misc. details if someone could help me find it, I understand it may potentially be delisted.

You could earn/pick through an array of fighter jets. The game had a campaign, I remember the first mission was where you launched and attacked enemy aircraft and vessels over the ocean. Mission 2 was attacking an island by first destroying the three shield generators to then attack the center of the island. There was an option for some form of a survival mode. The jets were based off of real aircraft but used fictional names. The jets had guns and missiles, two missiles at a time that refreshed after a few seconds after firing them, the guns overheated quickly. Those were the only weapons. The game had some form of a ranking system and you could earn different character icons and what not. The default view was 3rd person on the tail of the aircraft (chase view?) The game had mid tier graphics which were pretty good at the time. The game ""Air Combat Online"" looks similar but isn't the one.

***Volzerk***

*Catching Mou-Mons*

Score: 8/10

Did I enjoy it? Yes. Early on, this game is a blast to play as you try to capture and see all of the different monsters that it has to offer. Later parts of the game make the enjoyment wain quite a bit.

Would I come back to it? Probably not. Despite being so close to completing the game (Episode 9, Chapter 2), I found the difficulty spike to be less of a skill check and more of a numbers game. I foresaw this becoming increasingly an issue, so I figured it was as good a time to stop as any.

Personal Playtime: 13 hours

Volzerk: Monster and Lands Unknown is a visually stunning game with an enjoyable gameplay loop of defeating and taming monsters to become stronger. However, certain aspects make it less enjoyable for a complete playthrough.

The mechanics are a mix of simplicity and complexity. Real-time combat involves striking and dodging incoming attacks to defeat monsters and potentially tame them. There are also trash mobs called mini-mons that can be acquired randomly. Gameplay consists of story missions or expeditions, offering different objectives and freedom of navigation. The game features crossbreeding to unlock over 400 unique monsters.

Volzerk excels in its rich environment, a serviceable story lasting around 15 hours, and a great variety of monsters to encounter and catch. The allure lies in completing the monsterpedia, as each base monster has a unique design. The most enjoyable feature is crossbreeding, which creates new and stronger monsters with increased attributes.

However, the game has major caveats. Crossbreeding multiple times is locked behind main story events, limiting progress until later in the game. This disincentivized completing the monsterpedia for subsequent areas. There are significant progression walls, particularly midway and near the end of the main story, making instances difficult and discouraging further progress. The monetization is also a concern, as top and mid-tier heroes are exclusively accessible through real-life currency purchases, leaving a negative impression.

In conclusion, Volzerk is worth checking out for its unique monster-catching and breeding mechanics, but it may become stale and challenging in later stages. The game demands a significant time commitment. While there are some complaints and difficulty spikes, early enjoyment is still possible.

**TLDR: Volzerk: Monster and Lands Unknown is visually stunning, with a gameplay loop of defeating and taming monsters. It offers simplicity and complexity in mechanics, real-time combat, and crossbreeding. The rich environment, story, and monster variety are highlights. However, progression is hindered by locked features and difficulty spikes. Monetization raises concerns. Worth trying for unique mechanics, but time commitment and challenges exist.**

[Review] Age of Strategy - A turn based strategy game," **What is it?**

Age of Strategy is a 2D turned based strategy game. (As the name implies, duh) In this game you are able to choose between many civilization, each civilizations have unique troops. There are many buildings and technologies that may be required before training certain troops. As you progress you can earn gems, which can be used to unlock more upgrades in the game's upgrade tree.

&#x200B;

[How a normal game would probably look like](https://preview.redd.it/mv99yim0a18b1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=26c6759d48cc5eaf506ca3c98eaaf9179c672b08)

**Singleplayer /Offline Play**

There are numerous amounts of senarios, maps and even historical battles in the single player mode of this game. Some battles are large, and some are small. Typically larger battles may take up to two hours to complete while smaller battles can take less than 15 minutes. This will be your main source of gems when it comes to unlocking upgrades.

  
**Multiplayer**

Although it does not have hundreds of players playing every day, you will still have enough active players to find a game or two. The games are not real time, so you don't have to worry about not being able to finish a game. Instead, they are ""offline multiplayer"" each player must make their move within 24 hours.

  
**Attacking Strategies**

Each unit has it's advantages and disvantages. To use them effectively you must change and adapt on which units you should attack and which units you should avoid. Refer to the image below to see which units counter each other.  


[Who counters who](https://preview.redd.it/iw95tfk5a18b1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6cf0c4ddcd34cf402e6c70086502e2437b65df)

&#x200B;

**Upgrade tree**

There are many upgrades in the game, some of these upgrades unlock buildings, some unlock troops and technologies. Upgrades are a essential part of the game as it allows for more freedom and possibilities. Each civilization has unique troops. With that you will need unique buildings and technologies to train them.  


[Some of the units you can unlock](https://preview.redd.it/6ftxo1k7a18b1.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e6e00ac8649b4950131693e4e933cad006f613c)

**Turn based system**

Every turn you have you will have the chance to do many things. Moving and attacking with your units, produce troops and invent technologies. Your builders are also affected, every turn they can build once. After you are done with your actions you will end the turn, and your enemy will play.  


**Conclusion** 

I really enjoy this game, the sheer amount of content and play time for a free game is amazing.  Not to mention there are many other versions of the game the developer has made. The currency isn't much of a grind, but not as much where you can spend on every thing you want. This game is perfect for long car rides or plane trips as it doesn't require wifi to play. I recommend you giving the game a try because it sure is fun.

***Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon (Free W/Netflix Subscription)***

*Digging Up Them Holes*

Score: 8.5/10

Did I enjoy it? Yes! It was a great experience with a ton of variety to choose from changing the feel of the core gameplay. .  

Would I come back to it? Yes there is quite a bit to unlock and the process of unlocking them with the currency that you obtain in game is actually enjoyable.  

Personal Playtime: \~4 hours

The gameplay revolves around puzzle matching, where players strategically stack and attack groups of enemies. Each enemy has different attributes, such as higher attack power or increased health, requiring players to adapt their strategies. Boss battles introduce unique skills, and defeating them allows players to play as those bosses in future runs. These characters have distinct passives that greatly impact gameplay. The game also includes a hub where players can buy relics and world skips using gems, the primary currency obtained during runs. There are quite a few unlockables with several of them hidden behind different mechanics and risk reward analysis with keys. I do have a minor gripe about optimization both in terms of touch sensitivity and orientation for the cutscenes but they are minor at best. If you have a netflix subscription this is a no brainer. Depending on how much you are planning on getting out of one this game has several hours worth of content that I have yet to clock in. I would highly recommend you give it a look and try out the roguelike mode for added difficulty. 

**TLDR:The gameplay revolves around strategic puzzle matching, stacking and attacking enemies with different attributes. Defeating bosses unlocks them as playable characters with unique skills.

***Beast League***

*Got That Dog In Em’*

Score: 7.5/10

Did I enjoy it? yes, I was not expecting it to play as well as it did.  

Would I come back to it? No, I feel like there is limited playability to it because as mentioned in the full review section it can become extremely pay to win if you are not willing to commit to the significant grind. 

Personal Playtime: \~2 hours

If it is not known, I am a big fan of sports games, particularly football and basketball, as these were genres that I invested a significant amount of time in. I do not walk into titles expecting AAA quality of gameplay or graphics; rather, my enjoyment comes in terms of the unique qualities that the game presents or what the game focuses on. Beast League took me by surprise in that you are playing a game of 1-on-1 with different animal characters. Each character has a different ultimate ability that can change the tides of battle. You level up your character using currency that can be collected in the game or using real-world currency. The actual gameplay is really enjoyable with the constant push-pull struggle of playing a more defensive or offensive game based on the shot clock, current character HP, positioning, and nitro (your ability to fly for a short period of time). The game does have some notable flaws. The first is that the game can be a bit pay-to-win. I didn't ever realize this in terms of the damage dealt when trying to steal the ball (running into the enemy player) or speed (some characters are faster than others innately), but it was super evident in terms of the HP of the goal. Considering that you drain your opponents HP by scoring (points distributed by type of shot, distance, speed, and shot angle), I managed to run into someone that had three times the HP that I did (to put that into context, I would have to make roughly 11 good shots to drain their HP while they only need four to drain mine). The other thing to note is that while there is a leaderboard, it only tracks the highest-level players, meaning that it is practically useless for the majority of the player base. (I wish there was constant score tracking.) There is an energy system, but that only affects your ability to gain more points in the battle pass (another possible red flag for some people), not your ability to actually play the game. All of that being said, I do think that it is at least worth checking out if you are a fan of basketball, as there are some interesting takes on the typical game of 1 on 1.

**TLDR:As a sports game enthusiast, I appreciate unique qualities and focuses. Beast League surprised me with its 1-on-1 animal character battles, each with different ultimate abilities. Gameplay involves strategic decisions based on shot clock, character HP, positioning, and nitro. However, the game has pay-to-win elements, particularly with goal HP imbalance. The leaderboard is limited to highest-level players, and there is an energy system affecting the battle pass, not gameplay. Still, basketball fans should check it out for its interesting take on 1-on-1 games.**

*Too Old School*

Score: 6.5/10

Did I enjoy it? I really wanted to. After the initial hit of dopamine and the possibilities that are afforded to the player, I slowly came to see that there are some old school aspects that are better forgotten.  

Would I come back to it? No, this is a shame considering how interesting some of the locales and bosses can be.

Triglav can be an enjoyable game if you are looking to turn your brain off and go for some old-school isometric dungeon crawling. This may be up your alley. However, considering some of the limitations that that comes with and the countless other games that just do it better, I have a hard time recommending this title. For starters, there are some cool aspects of the game, such as some enemy design and the puppet system (used to respawn in your inventory). However, this is overshadowed by the limit of 12 items (6 of which are equipable) \[why not just limit the puppets one can carry? \], the lack of indicators for different stats (this makes it very difficult to tell if one build is that much better than another), and worst of all, the lack of weight attached to any of your actions. It just feels like you are waiting for the health bar to go down more than actually being in combat. It's not a bad game in fact there are so many unique parts of the game that I've read that are really enjoyable; however, after my 2 hours of playtime, I have no interest in returning.

**TLDR:Triglav is an enjoyable old-school isometric dungeon crawling game if you want a brain-off experience. It has cool enemy design and a puppet system, but limitations like a small item inventory and lack of stat indicators hinder the gameplay. The lack of weight to actions and combat diminishes the overall experience. While not a bad game, I have no interest in returning after a 2-hour playtime. There are better alternatives available.**

***Dungeon Village 2 ($5.99)***

*It Takes a Village* 

Score 8.5/10

Personal Playtime: 6 hours

Dungeon Village 2 is a great simulator game. It puts you in the position of a mayor who has to build the resources that villagers are going to need to go out there and quest on your behalf. These buildings range from inns for them to sleep in after battle to weapons shops so that they can buy gear. Along the way you will complete missions and fulfill certain requirements to increase your village rating and attract more villagers. This can be done via events, having certain buildings, or just adding to the scenery. The entire time you will be managing the cost of maintaining your facilities and the loot that you get from slaying monsters and clearing dungeons. The biggest downside is that the game’s speed modifier is locked until you complete the first world. This process can take about 5 hours. This is a huge QOL mechanic and for those that like the gameplay loop its addition only exponentially increases the enjoyment. It is easy to modify your village structure and adding and removing buildings works well compared to a lot of other games. I am happy to say that this is a great title to check dip your toes into the Karisoft developer as by all accounts this is one of their better titles. I really enjoyed this game and is a great game to just zone out and enjoy the progression to. I would recommend it as a relaxing sim title!

***Raging Bytes ($7.99)***

*Byting Off More Than It can Chew* 

Score 7/10

Personal Playtime: 5 hour

Raging Bytes is a mixed bag. On one hand the actual gameplay is incredibly fun at least for the early part of the game. The decision making of choosing to fight one zombie vs squaring off against a horde is something that few games correctly capture. However, as the game progresses this becomes less and less of a bright spot in the game because zombie’s ranged attacks discourage you from engaging in the first place. While the scenery is great as far as variety goes, the journey to get there leaves a lot to be desired. I felt like the game really wanted the story to be the main focus and unfortunately, in my opinion, it is the weakest part of the game. There were some moments that made it somewhat worth it particularly the ending section but it never really comes together like I think the developers intended to. It is a skeletal justification to kill zombies. For zombie lovers I think it is a great addition but for everyone else at a price point of $7.99 I would have enjoyed something a bit more dynamic.

***Indies’ Lies***

*Indie Darling* 

Score 8/10

Personal Playtime: 3 hours

Indies’ Lies is a roguelike deck builder with as much variety as there is complexity. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it as there were plenty of different combos in terms of decks and party variety. This was the concept that separated it out from others. Along your journey after defeating bosses you are able to recruit a party member to aid you in combat; these can be a front line or back line support  and provide you with cards that do different things depending on their positioning in combat. There are not too many ads with the only mandatory ones being when you have to fight a boss. I will say that I am not the biggest fan of some of the ad models where you would have to watch them if you wanted to get a certain item. These items are, as you would expect, often very good and make it difficult to pass up. There are DLC unlocks that you can get which get you access to more characters. Overall I am glad that I had the opportunity to play this game and it is one that I see myself recommending to others in the future!

***Unicycle Legend***

*Maintaining Balance* 

Score 6.5/10

Personal Playtime: 1 hour

Unicycle legends is a game that I decided to try out on a whim after looking at games that had been released this year. I had some trepidation with the over simplistic graphic design and my first impressions of the movement were not  the best. However when I realized that the quirky movements were part of the experience similar to QWOP, I had it grow on me. There are a total of 120 levels each of which have their own theme. Over the course of the game you will die a lot and the game offers the ability to skip levels if you find them too difficult by watching an ad. I don't know if this was intentional but there were some times where I was prompted for an ad even though I didn't choose to use it. It would then cause me to skip the level that I was currently on. This happened several times over the course of my 1 hour so much so that it became frustrating. It wasn’t clear if this was just an attempt related thing or if it thought that I was clicking the skip level button. I will say that the game itself is a solid time sink as the movement is janky enough to make navigating a bit difficult but consistent enough to cause you to get better.

***Blades Shooter: Survival Games***

*On A Knife’s Edge* 

Score 6/10

Personal Playtime: \~2 hours

Blade Shooter:Survival Games is another game that follows the same mold as pickle pete, tomb raider reloaded, and[ survivor.io](http://surivor.io/) in terms of across the game progression. What sets it apart from these games is the fixed screen shoot em’ up design that it has. This alone makes it worth checking out if you are either new to the genre or are a fan. The gameplay can be pretty dynamic the first few runs that you play but after a while the game can get a little stale if the genre does not resonate with you. There is a ton of possible progression but you have to be very committed to see it through. The game does not do anything egregiously wrong in terms of ad placement as these seem to be limited to revives and getting additional items in the in-game shop. However that same in-game shop is what holds it back. Whales:BEWARE this can be a game that you can sink tons of money into. It doesn't have to be like that but I'm sure at some point the progression halts. I just was not committed enough to see where that wall was.

Gaming on the S23 Ultra with the Razer Raiju is a match made in heaven,"Hey everyone!

I just wanted to share my experience gaming on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with the Razer Raiju controller. Let me just say, it's been an absolute dream.

Firstly, the S23 Ultra's display is incredible. The screen is massive, with a 6.8 inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel that offers a resolution of 3200 x 1440 pixels. When combined with the Razer Raiju controller, the gaming experience is truly immersive. The controller is incredibly responsive, with precise button input that makes it easy to execute complex moves in games.

I've played a variety of games on this setup, from fast-paced shooters to slow and strategic RPGs. The controller's ergonomic design is comfortable to hold for extended periods of time, and the customizable buttons and triggers make it easy to adapt to different games.

The S23 Ultra's powerful processor and ample RAM make sure that games run smoothly, without any lag or stuttering. And with a battery that lasts all day, I can game for hours on end without worrying about running out of juice.

Overall, I highly recommend gaming on the S23 Ultra with the Razer Raiju controller. It's a truly premium experience that offers excellent performance and comfort. If you're a serious mobile gamer, this setup is definitely worth considering.

Curiosity Regarding The Base Building Games,"Rise of Kingdoms, Lords Mobile, Top War, Avony, Mafia City, Age of Origins, State of Survival, Clash of Clans, Call of Dragons, Rise of Empires, Frost and Flame, The freaking lord of rings, pirates of the Caribbeans, Last Shelter:The Walking Dead, STAR TREK, etc.... there's like a million more.

Guys. Guys. Help me understand. Why are there so many base building games on mobile. They're all practically the same too. You spend a vast majority of your time building a base, upgrading it, and being heavily incentived to spend money because these games (barring CoC) are all heavily P2W. If you're F2P you'll have to ve considerably patience and accepting of your perpetual disadvantage. They require a lot of time and money. 

All for what? The same large-scale wars that gives just enough required to allow these games to be called strategy games: Kingdom vs Kingdom or Server vs Server events. I'm literally playing ANOTHER base builder (The Ants: Underground Kingdom) to see if this genre is worth playing with. they all are very profitable games and have dedicated playerbases (barring devs doing dumb things), so outside of simple addiction, people are actually enjoying these games and are accepting of the P2W nature.

Does this exist?,"So there are sooo many I'm not sure what to call them but games where you build a city or empire or whatever and ends up with you having to join an alliance or clan and waging war on every one else.  Is there a game like that where you don't have to wage war?  I love the building part of those and I like having to go into the world to battle mobs and NPCs but I am not serious enough to be competitive in those games.  For me mobile games are just a few min before bed or if I can't sleep but those games get dominated by people who put way too much time and money into them so I'm just constantly raided and can't enjoy them.  So is there any games similar but that I don't have to engage with other people?

Looking for visuals-only game for when I'm singing my toddler to sleep,"I need your help, it's hard to describe the type of game I'm looking for and I've got limited time and specific requirements. 

When I'm putting the toddler to bed, after lights out, I'm usually singing a lullaby with lyrics. It takes 10ish minutes to put her down, which is an ETERNITY if all you've got going on in your mind is lyrics to the wheels on the bus. I have discovered that if I turn my phone brightness way down low + dimming with a red night filter on, I can be on my phone while I do it. 

My usual go-to visuals only game for when I'm listening to audiobooks is ""I love hue"" which is infinitely playable, and I love it, but doesn't work with the dimming and night filter. I've got a candy-crush type match 3 game, but I burn through 5 lives in about 3 min and then I'm left twiddling my thumbs. Other games I've tried:

2048 - numbers I read out in my head, too distracting. 
Atomas - love the game, too many letters/numbers/reading. 
Two dots - too boring
Tetris - I get really competitive with it and also the touchscreen controls usually suck. I'm old school with the keyboard/controller for this one. 
Cut the rope - good contender, but the ads make the free version unplayable, and I find the physics mechanic 
Mini metro - the logic is kind of mentally involved iirc,. I need to be making up lyrics on the fly if required. But I've only played it on the PC so might give this another go.

Graphically it was not pixeled. It has a frontal view of the building.  
At that time I played it only on an ipad, I don't know if it had an iphone version. I don't remember the exact year, it could be comprehended between 2011 and 2015.

Car manufacturing game,"Hi everyone!

I am a software developer (not a game dev) who likes to play mobile games from time to time, generally tycoons. The type of game I was looking for was a car company tycoon, but I was disappointed in what Google Play offered me. I know some games approach this idea, but I am not happy with any of them, because they either have simple and not accurate research trees or they are built only to show ads.

So, my idea is to build... well, my own car manufacturing tycoon. The main things I have in mind:

* a more realistic research tree/car setup. A good example of this would be ""Automation, The Car Company Tycoon"" on Steam. However, I am not interested in the 3D part, but in the technical parts.
* in terms of gameplay itself, the best example I have in mind is ""Game Dev Tycoon"", but built for cars. Instead of game engines, you have car engines & car platforms, etc.

What I want to know from you:

1. would you be interested in playing such a game? Should I try to release it once I have a decent version?
2. are there any other game mechanics/features you would like to see in a game like this?

Please keep in mind that I am an experienced software dev, but not a game dev, so it might take some time to build something decent. It might never happen.

Need help in choosing a gaming phone,"Hello, 

I buy phones almost every year but Ive always stayed within the samsung and apple eco system. 

In 2019 I got the Samsung Note 10 plus - still very much useable and not really laggy. Problem is the battery empties out more when using it for gaming. 

In 2020 - I got the Apple 12 pro max. Pretty much deteriorated the battery to 85% within the year and then well right now I just use it for soc med apps. I cant use it for mobile gaming because it heats up so fast, lags the game and battery is worse than the  note 10 plus. 

In 2022 - i got the Apple 13 mini. Just an everyday phone. Not used for gaming or anything. Battery runs out fast even with ust regularuse. 

In 2023 - i got the Samsung s23 plus. It has really good battery life, doesnt lag. And ive tried it in gaming it works so well. BUT, i know that if I constantly use this for gaming this everyday phone wouldnt last me the whole day anymore. 

Now im left with a couple of options and would need your opinions because Im not entirely sure which would serve well for the amount I will be dishing out. 

Below are the options along with their descriptions (Amounts in CAD prior to 12% tax) 

Samsung S24 Ultra (12GB ram + 512GB) - $1959.99 srp or if I trade in my s23 plus it will be $1029.99
  1. Processor - snapdragon 8 gen 3
  2. Battery - 5000 mAh
  3. Screen - Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, HDR10+, 2600 nits     (peak)

Asus ROG Phone 8 pro (24GB ram + 1TB) - $1999 srp then there is a n option to do a monthly payment of 92$ a month for 24 months
  1. Processor - snapdragon 8 gen 3
  2. Battery - 5500 mAh
  3. Screen - LTPO AMOLED, 1B colors, 165Hz, HDR10, 1600 nits (HBM), 2500 nits (peak

Nubia Red Magic 9 pro (16GB + 512 GB) - around $1,200 
  1. Processor - snapdragon 8 gen 3
  2. Battery - 6500 mAh
  3. Screen - AMOLED, 1B colors, 120Hz, 1600 nits (peak)

OnePlus 12 (24GB + 1TB) - around $1800 
  1. Processor - snapdragon 8 gen 3
  2. Battery - 5400 mAh
  3. Screen - LTPO AMOLED, 1B colors, 120Hz, Dolby Vision, HDR10+, 600 nits (typ), 1600 nits (HBM), 4500 nits (peak)


Please suggest with the following in mind:

1. Best for its price point 
2. For longevity of its life (from keeping updates and having it for the next 2-4 yrs) 
3. Im not a big camera/picture peson

Appreciate your opinions!

[GAMEDEV] My first Idle RPG Project progress after 5 weeks : Idle Beast Hunter,"Hello everyone ! I got a ton of progress done this week ! (also updated the test versions like 7 times)

&#x200B;

My game has all the classics from growth idle / Incremental games, a basic resource dropped on enemies, a prestige resource by restarting at stage1,  
On top of that I wanted to add a gear system that would remember of games like diablo, and it already feels pretty good ! Gear that you drop in dungeons in the ""Challenge"" Menu,

Now the roadmap for next 1/2 weeks is to make the gear generation happen on the server and make gear scales (for now it does not depend on the dungeon level / player progress),At the same time, make a new content ""cavern"" where you dig through the ground in a 200x200 grid to obtain relics (stat boost and special abilities like stage skip, enemy hp down, boost to overall stats)The idea is to share the location of the relics between all players and make it a ""teamwork"" to discover all the relics !

Most sprites are from ansimuz, some enemies are made with acolytes ai, reworked on Aseprite, and some bosses are from Duelyst :D

I hope you guys enjoy my game and send valuable feedback (critics are always welcome as well !!) I will work hard at making it better, I want it to become a great idle game !

Here is the link to my itch for a free test version again on iOS and Android ! [https://mksidev.itch.io/idle-beast-hunter](https://mksidev.itch.io/idle-beast-hunter)

You do not need to give any data when logging in the game, just click ""Guest Login"" and you are good to go ! In the settings menu then you can bind your account if you want to !

PS : Very important detail, the game will be 100% f2p (no IAP to get stronger), will only include skins, and optional ads that players would watch from their own initiative to support :)  
And the big copy error log button is there in case the screen gets covered with error messages, so it can easily be reported :) then just close app and reopen to have it gone !

Have a great weekend, and thank you so much for reading !

Old mobile alien cow game,"I am trying to remember the name of an old mobile game where you defended cows from aliens invading. I played it somehwere around 2011-2017 probably. Sometimes the aliens would travel against different paths in each round getting harder each round. And sometimes it was a big field you could create your own path with different weapons. As you killed the aliens you would get coins and then you could buy more weapons and upgrade the weapons you have. One game play had a predetermined number of aliens and it would get harder or higher each round and another game play was endless where you just tried to last as many rounds of invasions as possible. I also remember there were different types of aliens to fight against. There were regular ones, some were like conjoined then ones you hit them they would split and be two separate ones, some were really big, some were the king ones that were huge (usually coming out at the end of a round), and some could fly over the hedges and weapons.

Games to play with family,"Hi guys, hopefully this is the right space/sub/flair/etc to ask this!

&#x200B;

I have a lot of family members kind of spread out over the US and we like to connect upon occasion and games are pretty easy to pick up and play. The main problem I have is we don't usually have the same schedule or anything! We were originally ""playing"" Habitica, where you can log in and leave messages/chat at any time of the day. 

I was curious if anyone has any other similar style of mobile games that would fit the bill?

Ideally, it would be free, easy to pick up (a lot of my family are older and not so tech-savvy.) and have the same style of ""check-in"" complete a turn/action and be done for the day/time frame until someone else pops on. (Similar to Scrabble, but we all hate Scrabble and it's more of a 1:1 rather than ""party""/""family"" game.)

"Recommend me games like Pokemon Unite, but without the thrash.","I love Unite's gameplay. I genuinely enjoy it. It's simpler than Wild Rift, it has colorful graphics, and I think gameplay-wise, it's everything a mobile game should be: a fun, simple pastime with a clean UI that can still be challenging if taken seriously.

But aside from the gameplay... Man does this game suck.

Stat-boosting emblem system, new pokemon being de-facto paywalled and OP for the first few weeks, a gacha system designed to literally never let you win big and exploit FOMO to get payouts, and six in-game pop-up ads appearing as soon as I launch the game. (I counted.)

Everything in the game is designed to funnel money out of parents' wallets, even worse than *literal gachas* like Genshin Impact, which actually makes the F2P experience fun and keeps the ""you can pay money to win this game!"" marketing inside the store and battlepass windows where it belongs.

**So, I ask for recs. Do you know any game like Pokemon Unite but... less thrash?**

How to find good games?,"I have a Google Pixel 7 Pro and play Pass
I'm not sure if there's a search algorithm that I can tweak but it's been insanely hard to find a good single player game. My entire Play Store feed is dominated by the Kairosoft games and other copy paste reskinned games. 
I don't mind paying money for a good game, either. 

Some games that I've really enjoyed so far are:
Wanna Survive!
Sara is Missing
I am Innocent
Plague Inc
The Enchanted Cave 2 (underrated in my opinion)
Out There: Omega Edition
80 Days
Fallout Shelter (meh)

Best Mobile Online RPG 2023 so Far,"Hi y’all,

Over the last 5ish days I’ve been searching for an online RPG to play on my IPad as I go out of town for work.

Here are my findings incase it helps anyone, and maybe someone else has insights for me about any of the games based on my opinions.

Here’s a quick list of the games I’ve tried :

MaplestoryM
Old School RuneScape (OSRS)
Regular RuneScape 
Dofus Touch
Albion Online
Diablo Immortal

As of tonight :

#1 Diablo Immortal
- Leveling grind has been fun and simple and rewarding.
- World feels lively as you see lots of players running around.

#2 Albion Online
- Game actually was more fun than Diablo Immortal and I was excited to go fully into this one however I found out eventually it forces you into PvP which I’m not looking to do. Stopped playing for that reason.

#3 MaplestoryM 
- I wanted to grind this game so bad as I used to love it back in the day however it’s beyond overwhelming and confusing as to what you’re supposed to do and when for gear. Feels very complicated however if it wasn’t I’d easily be playing this over the top two.

The RuneScapes are RuneScapes not much to say, it feels like I’m having to tab out way too much to figure stuff out such as quests and what to do and where to go. If there was more in game direction I’d love to give the newer RuneScape more time as OSRS just feels too outdated graphic wise.

#4 Dofus Touch
- Feels impossible to find a guide for this game as there are a lot of characters with a shit ton of options as to how to build them. If you’re lucky enough to find a guide in my experience it’s in French which doesn’t help and no guide I could find was in depth enough to keep the grind worth it without feeling like you’re messing something up or not doing anything properly.

To sum, I wish MaplestoryM was simpler for learning how to properly gear and that would be number 1.

Albion seems perfect until realizing you have to PvP.

Diablo Immortal is top dog as of right now for me.

We’ll see how it goes over the next few days.",2,18bvpeg,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/18bvpeg/best_mobile_online_rpg_2023_so_far/,7,2023-12-06 04:22:16,goatmasalareddit,True,False,False,0.67,2,0
What are games I can recommend/gift to my mom for Christmas?,"My mom has a 2019 Samsung tablet. She hasn't been into games most of my life but recently started asking me for recommendations. I never know what to say, as I don't really play mobile games. She shows me the puzzle games she likes (colour-matching, etc) but they seem spammy with ads to me. She used to like Wordscape until it reset her progress. 

I was thinking of gifting her a Google Play Pass and making a booklet of game summaries that she might consider. Or she could use the money to purchase specific games or ad-free versions of games.

I was considering suggesting Stardew Valley and Machinarium (both on play pass), both of which I really enjoyed on PC. Stardew Valley might be too complicated, but I think it would be worth a try.

Free games that I've seen snippets of as sponsors for Youtubers that looked potentially good and her speed:
- June's Journey
- Love and Pies
- Toon Blast

Since they're free, the gift would be more about including the info in the booklet. While I personally dislike pay 2 win, she might consider using some of the gift money in free games.

What do you all think of these game ideas for tablet? Any other recommendations? Either on Play Pass, to purchase or free?

I vaguely remember never having enough block textures. The game had kits you could buy with new blocks and worlds you could edit. You as a player had a limited number of blocks to build your game and online games were usually more fun. There was a base game map that I built on. I know at some point in the map there is a bridge and most of it is  green block for grass with a path going through it. You could code the character player. I think I remember there being an action button that looked like it was from a comic book and an upward arrow button but I'm not sure. And there was a joystick to control characters/vehicles depending on the level. The character coding allowed you to control pretty much exactly how the game would function.

Forgot the name of tower conquer game,"I am searching for a mobile game I loved to play, but unfortunately I can't remember the name. I already searched in my AppStore and my old Google Play Store in my purchased games, but I can't find it.

\> The game I search for has a landscape with many levels on it. The goal of each level is to conquer all towers by sending troops of your first towers to the neutral or enemy ones. 

\> Each tower (which is not neutral) generates troops, which you can send to other towers and use them as said to conquer enemy towers, strengthen and level your own towers or convert them to different troops (next point).

\> There are three/four different types of towers. Tents, which generate faster troops, towers with horns with stronger troops and castle towers with bigger defensive stats. I'm not sure if there are also standard towers with no special stats.

I would be really happy if you can help me finding the game. I already spent over 1 1/2 hours searching yesterday, but I just can't find it.

Are there any kingdom building games without the peer-to-peer war mechanic?,"I've enjoyed my time with Ant Legion, and I used to play Star Wars Commander back in the day, which is basically a Clash of Clans clone, but I always get frustrated with the fact that you have to constantly worry about someone attacking and looting your base.

Is there any game out there like Clash of Clans, but without the clashing? Just want a game where I can focus on building and upgrading, gathering resources, etc. like in the aforementioned games, but don't have to worry about attacking or defending what I've got.

So I came here to ask if this rings a bell for anyone, and if they remembered it's name.

Asking since I'm an ""I don't need sleep, I NEED ANSWERS"" sorta guy.

And this is going to just bug tf out of me. 

Other details about the game:

It was not a pixel game

Protag is purple hoodie girl, probably 12, brown hair, side ponytail.

Baby wears blue baby pajamas, blond hair in a sort of rubber glove looking haircut, has a pacifier most of the time.

Gameplay is less temple runner, and more dragging the two protags through obstacles with zombies chasing after you from a top to bottom perspective (bullet echo)

Baby shoots automatically and needs to reload every now and then, Girl can every now and then or as a powerup, melee when zombies are to close.

You can buy better stuff from a machine gun to an alien blaster thing for the baby, better melee options for ghe Girl, and powerups.

Simple Farming Games?,"Hey all,

Is there any decent farming game I could play that wouldn’t constantly encourage me to play with friends and check on the notifications and pay money to get extra energy/stuff/whatever?

I really just want a farm on my own, few cows to take care of and to avoid this disgusting „modern 3D” graphics (it can still be 3D, just not in the vibe of modern FarmVille)

I can even pay, but pay for the game once, not on monthly basis.

A list of the best mobile games I've come across the past years,"Just wanted to share my list of best mobile games over the last couple years. Especially with the amount of 'fake/clickbaity' games out there good games seem to be a rare occurrence.

Top 10 (random order):
1. The Way Home (Roguelike)
Pixelated roguelike with replayable story or endless arena mode. Fun gameplay and good story with some humor. You can tell the devs put in effort.

2. Creatures Of The Deep: Fishing (calm relaxing game)
Haven't played this for that long but it has been the best relaxing game I've played. Great artstyle too.

3. Gumslinger (Western shootout game??)
No clue what genre this is but a very fun and simple shooter. Feels like a arcade game. Simple controls but hard to master.

4. Tap Dig My Museum (Museum Tycoon)
It's like any Tycoon game but with dinosaur fossils. Except it has a pixelated artstyle. Even after 20 hours of gameplay you keep getting new mechanics/options.

5. Bloody Bastards (Fighting game)
Physics based. My god this one is addicting. Once you get the hang of it you just want to unlock everything. Has online too.

6. Cafe Racer (Endless Racer)
If you like motorcycles and customizing them this is perfect. Low poly artstyle. Only downside is that once you have every bike with all upgrades there isn't much more to do. But very fun game for sure!

7. Grand Mountain Adventure (Open world skiing/snowboarding)
A relaxing game at first but slowly starts getting more and more challenging. Has multiple open worlds.

8. Reaper (Side Scroller)
This one is my absolute favourite. I bought the deluxe version or whatever it was called and it was 100% worth it. Great story with decisions that impact the game world. Multiple game modes. RPG character building. 10/10

9. Pixel Car Racer (Drag Racing Game)
I feel like everyone loves this game. So addicting. Active community on Reddit but sadly no more updates. And once you have the fastest cars there was no point to play anymore for me, but still fun!

10. Mini Metro (Puzzle Game)
Pretty well-known as well but IMO the best puzzle game. It's relaxing and challenging at the same time. Basically, you design metro lines in the most efficient way while demand grows.

 Honorable Mention: Pocket City (1!  not 2, 2 sucks)
Just a fun city builder

Looking for an RPG Online for Android ( more info in the post ),"Hello all, I have made some other posts looking for an RPG game that I can fall in love with and I have tried a few this past weeks. Therefore I am doing another post trying to detail what exactly I am looking for and bringing in the games I have played ( or I am currently playing ) and what are they missing.

So, what I am looking for is, a classical RPG, portrait mode, with a class system that has impact in the game, with classic gear system ( sockets, enchants, upgrades, item quality ), with PvP ( I don't care if the enemies are controlled by AI, I just want to face other people characters in the arena ), with guilds, with something to do every X hours ( call it energy system but let me play more than 5 min every hour please ), with customization ( like being able to write a bio for my character and this kind of stuff ). And additionally but not a must, let it be ""serious"" ( it can be cartoon but I don't like foolish games, I don't know how to explain better ).

I know this is a LOT of things and that's why I never found THE game.

 I am currently playing:

**Orna ARPG**

Truly awesome game that I am enjoyining, no energy system, a wide variety of classes, classic gear system, pvp, guilds... this game rocks. But the drawbacks for me are, classes are swappable ( I prefer to have one character per class rather than onme character than can swap back and forth ), and the sprite of your character is not customizable, you have a sprite and you are this everytime, even if you equip a hammer, if your sprite is a guy with a sword, it will have a sword. Stupid I know but I care about this things. For the rest, the game is truly awesome and I am looking forward to keep playing it. Also it has a deep skill system which I like.

**Shakes and fidgets**

I playd for a few hours with a warrior, deleted it and I am going for a battlemage now. Game looks really fun for a time based gameplay where you send your hero to quests and then you collect the exp, gold and loot. There are classes but there only affects the stats and a unique passive, combat is automatic and that's it, your only impact in the game is choosing the gear ( always the best you have tbh ) and to keep improving your character so it can win more battles against stronger enemies. Honestly? If it had a little more complex battle system and ( optionally ) a more serious interface this game would be even cooler. I am going to play it still for a few days to see what's going on, it is a good approach of what I am looking for.

Please if you know some games that can fit into my desires feel free to tell me :)",4,13y6iww,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/13y6iww/looking_for_an_rpg_online_for_android_more_info/,5,2023-06-02 08:04:56,Mivadeth,True,False,False,1.0,4,0

***Roundguard ($6.99)***

*Round and Round* 

Score 8/10

Personal Playtime: 5 hours

I’m going to be honest; Roundguard is a little difficult for me to review. The reason for this is that originally I was planning on giving this game a much lower score because I really did not see the appeal. However, I think that this is because I was expecting a different game. It is a dungeon crawler first and foremost, and everything else second. By this, I mean to say that there are very defined classes, which, don't get me wrong, are well crafted but limited in terms of build diversity once selected. Once I overlooked that aspect and stopped trying to make square pegs fit round holes, I began to enjoy the game a lot more. Even at the cost of $6.99, it is a good experience. That being said, I do think that I summed it up pretty well in my video review: ""If you are willing to go through and complete each difficulty along with the modifiers, I cannot even begin to estimate the amount of time that would take. If you are not able to do that, then you’ll play it for a while, and after that, it’ll probably collect dust until you are ready to give it another whirl.""

**Chief Emoji Officer ($2.99)**

*CEO🟰👍*

Score 7/10

Personal Playtime: 1 hour

Chief Emoji Officer has you navigate up the corporate tech ladder as you try to convey your approval or disapproval via exclusively emjois. This is a unique premise, and for that alone, I thought it was worth giving it a try. I honestly liked my time with it, although it was really short-lived (1 hour). I felt like there could be some updates to address some of the issues as they relate to navigation and going back to revise some levels. I do not feel like this process was as streamlined as it should or could have been, and it held it back a bit in my eyes. Lastly, I do wish that the game was a little longer. Not in the sense that the game is just short, but I felt like some of the interactions and conversations were rushed. I would have loved to have seen a little bit more backstory about the characters or developed the relationships that are there a little bit more. While I can't give a blanket recommendation, I can say that I personally enjoyed my time with it.

***Torchlight Infinite*** 

*Infinite Possibilities*

Score 9/10

Personal Playtime: 4.5 hours

Torchlight Infinite is more of what you have come to expect of the series. As an ARPG similar to Diablo and Path of Exile you’ll build a character as you slowly progress toward getting better and better gear. There are several classes to choose from in addition to several subclasses within each one. The possibilities are almost endless. There isn't too much in the way of ads/monetization if you can stay away from optimal min-maxing and for that I am pretty thankful. It is an incredibly enjoyable experience for fans of the genre. The game is separated into seasons with each likely adding some persistent event to the core gameplay which will allow you to create a new character upon its completion and the start of a new one and your current character will be transferred over to a permanent season. However, there are two big things to note. The first is that it is an absolutely massive game at 6+ GB meaning that those that have limited storage capacity should beware as there are also regular updates. The second thing that I would have liked to have seen was from the start access to a hardcore solo self-found mode. This means that if your character dies then they are permanently dead and there is no access to items behind a shop. This plus a bit more difficulty would have made it a must play.

As the title says, I will be going on vacation soon and will need some down time distractions. I’ll be going with my family to Greece and some of the time I will be on the beach or chilling in the hotel.

I’m not a big mobile gamer and always thought that all the games are completely casual. But now, after trying to branch out, I don’t think that I can play them all casually. 

I downloaded a few like Grim Defender, Fruit Ninja, Pop Them, Hill Climb and TFT mobile.

Out of all of them, the only actually casual one was Pop Them. It gave me the best chill to action ratio. It’s a simple connect the colors game with some fun twists that don’t add to the difficulty that much.

Are You Interested In Company Simulation,"Hey! I’m not a developer, just a big fan of a game that I play, and think is super underrated and under appreciated, called SimCompanies. It’s a company simulation game available on browser, IOS and Android.

SimCompanies is an online multiplayer game where each player has their own company, and must rely on a market influenced by all players to produce and sell. Every item in the game requires other items, and/or labor cost, to produce, meaning that in order to produce a complex item, such as an airplane for example, you’ll more than likely buy smaller items used for that production from multiple other players. You can send direct contracts or buy off of a wide marketplace for the resources you need(although contracts are always cheaper). It’s competitive, and mostly requires communication and a bit of math and understanding.

The game also incorporates infrastructure limits and requires you to be effective in hiring executives to help you run your company. 

This game is also very anti-P2W. There are no ads, so there are optional in app purchases(they have to keep the lights on), but you cannot use money you spend on the game to collect resources. 

The game is very complex, so if you do choose to download SimCompanies, I am willing to help you as long as I can help grow the game that I love. I’m also apart of a Discord server that is aimed at helping new players grow and find business partners. I’ll drop my company name down below so you can message me in the game for help if you need it, and if you want to join the server, just ask and I will send you a link privately.

Second, I need it to be able to play my music (More specifically, BFG Division) while I play, which Roblox doesn’t allow for some god forsaken reason, which is a shame since it HAS options like these.

I'm realizing a large portion of devs use online mobile games as a scam practice. Might swear off mobile exclusive shooters and stuff.,"I've really come to the realization that there are some really scummy developers that use us as a fleshlight to make a quick few bucks and run. I went to download Apex Legends mobile, only to find it had been shut down. Read about it, found out it had nothing to do with popularity, but the devs ""weren't happen with the product"" basically, so it was a choice to just say fuck the playerbase, take the money, and run. This happens A LOT. Happened with Final Fantasy 7: First Soldeir, Rangers of Oblivion.

 What it feels like to me is development branches being paid to put forth a bit of effort to make a cool mobile game that will grab attention, do a good enough job that people are going to want to make purchases (Battle pass, cosmetics, what have you), keep it up for like a year, if that, and then turn around and close it so that they don't have to spend money to further the game or even keep the servers open because they've made enough prophet. They can just fill their duffle bags with our money and run. That way, they can spend a minimal amount to make a base game and a season or two before abruptly being like ""Sorry. We made our money back and then some, so now we don't want to keep making content. Glad you liked our game, but yeah. Fuck you."". It seems planned ahead when they do that shit. 

There aren't a lot of regulations for mobile, so they get away with it... With any luck, someone will come to the stage with a good lawyer, so the actual dog piss put of these developers, and get some standards set on thos shit. If you like a game, and it offers purchases, you should be able to feel free to buy what you want without having to worry about getting fucked over.

Made my childhood dream come true - finally! I released my first game (On mobile),"I can still remember how I got my first book on coding from my dad when I was about 10 years old. The language was called ""Small basic"". I instantly dreamed about all the games I would make.

Reality was disappointing, but I never stopped dreaming. Now half a year ago and almost 10 years after I got that book, I started to learn proper game development, and voila my first game is live on Google Play.

Its not AAA or anything, but thats only my beginning. It is such a great feeling knowing that all the ideas I still have in my Google notes saved can now can become reality step by step.

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LBInfinity.P4rtygames](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LBInfinity.P4rtygames)

I think there isnt any more explaination needed, the concept is pretty simple though. I've tried to add some unique minigames the establishment has not in that form. Of course I will keep on working on that and I have some great ideas I will implement in the future.

Need help finding game,"    About 2ish years ago I played a mobile game that I would like to find.  I cannot for the life of me find it and cannot remember the name. 

   
    Open on a world map, pick a free village. 

     There were booster cards you could buy. You got them randomly sometimes as well.  Boosters like better farming, better walls 


       Research tree was pretty big, especially for a mobile game. 


       There would randomly pop up a camp of bandits on the map. 

      You had to have certain items in order to hold a banquet. There were different levels of banquets.  


       You could back out of the village to see the map in order to find stashes of resources to send your scouts to pick up.  Meat silver vegetable etc  represented by small pics. 


        Players could vote on someone to hold a position? Not really clear on that one. 

       There was the village, the Parrish, then next step up and I can’t remember that either.  


       If anyone can help me I’d really appreciate it!!

I'm here today because I'm struggling to remember the name of a pretty old mobile game that I played all the time many years ago on my Ipad.
It was between 2014 ans 2017 I think. Maybe before but I'm not sure.
The gameplay was centered around some colored orbs that you had to combine and/or suppress, and would be in a typical fantasy-theme, with heroes to upgrade etc... (maybe with a Japanese touch)
I think there was the word ""Spirit"" in the name but I can be wrong.
And at the same time I was also playing the first version of the game Ayakashi (now named Ayakashi :Ghost Guild), if that can help tou remember which time period it was then.

"Does anyone know an Old mobile game featuring a fat blonde white kid as the main character in ""temple run"" like games."," 

I used to play these mobile games back when I was younger. It was of this fat white kid with blonde hair who was usually the main character. Ive searched on the appstore for all the genres of the games I remember, but I cant find it at all. There were many games of him. They were sort of edgy, humorous games where you just beat your high score. One was skiing, but the main ones were him going through a temple run style game and he dies gruesomely when you lose. My memory of the game is kind of bad, so please ask me questions. Thanks!!!!! It would help me a lot if you told me the game name.

Details:

\-slapstick humor

\-when he dies, he explodes

\-was very popular back at that time

\-Had alot of games under the same main character

\-App thumbnail had the kids face in it

Ended up learning some things and came back to make the backdrop of this game more cozy and interesting. 

Do you like it ? 

It's a casual clicker game about managing traffic at a busy intersection called ""Crossroads"".

Basically, you manage the passage / stopping of cars by controlling the 4 blocks in the middle. Starts off easy peasy, but becomes difficult as the game goes on. 

I would be happy if you were to play and enjoy it. Any suggestions and feedback is also welcome.

Games like those misleading ads,"I’m looking for a mindless game that actually plays out like those misleading ads that have an idiot demoing the “game” and you get pissed watching it so you download it to prove your worth but it ends up being some jank ass resource management thing with tons of IAPs.

Willing to spend $1-5 as a one-time purchase to disable ads, but prefer no IAPs otherwise. 

Most recently I’ve been interested in the one where you’re running forward, like in Temple Run, with a weapon and an army — and you can expand your army by running through certain points (eg. +10 vs. x5) and you can upgrade your weapon by successfully shooting down an upcoming crate’s HP bar.

I’ve also been interested in the one — kinda like Centipede — where there’s a bunch of segments on a snake/dragon thing with different HP bars each which may contain weapon upgrades and the head snaps back to the body every time you destroy a segment.

There’s also the makeover ones and the mansion-repair ones and the puzzle ones I used to be more interested in, but I haven’t seen them in a while so I’m more fixated on finding a dupe for Last War: Survival (or whatever) at the moment.

Types of handheld gaming and where the different popular handhelds fit in," So I've posted before about my gaming ecosystem and what devices I use for different types of gaming, but thought I'd share my view on what an optimised handheld would look like for each category of games. I'm using 7-inch screen as the standard screen size for all of the below, so I won't repeat that.

**Type 1 - PC gaming:**

* ABXY button layout
* D-pad below the left joystick
* View button on the top left and menu button on the top right
* Xbox or Steam button (Windows has xbox game bar built in which can be triggered by Xbox button and Steam has steam overlay which can be triggered by Steam button)
* Windows or Steam OS based (depending on what platforms and games you play)
* Dedicated quick menu button for bringing up device control overlays
* X86 processor
* 16gb RAM
* 512gb storage
* Game launcher as the default Windows launcher (something like PlayNite)

I've chosen the SteamDeck for me. I'm unable to play certain games in SteamOS, but managing Windows on handhelds is just too much work at the moment. Until Windows 12 Handheld comes out (not confirmed just hopeful thinking based on their hackathon at the beginning of this year), I will stick with SteamOS device.

**Type 2 - Cellphone gaming (Android or iOS):**

* Separate gaming phone so that landscape, portrait, touch and controller based games can all be played
* Telescopic controller with ABXY button layout
* Telescopic controller with D-pad below the left joystick
* Dedicated home button on bottom left and back button on bottom right
* Full screen symmetrical phone with no or very minimal camera cut-out
* High end (Snapdragon 8 Latest Gen Chip) chip
* 12gb RAM
* 512gb storage
* Game launcher when connected to the telescopic controller and touch launcher when not connected to telescopic controller

I have not yet decided on the device for me that will cover this, but it may be an Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate. Expecting a telescopic controller from Asus too or use a backbone or the new Gamesir controller.

**Type 3 - Retro gaming:**

* BAYX button layout with maybe PS button layout printed on the Handheld face next to each button. This is because majority of games being emulated usually use the BAYX or PS button layouts
* D-pad above the left joystick. Some may disagree with me on this, but dpad and face buttons are the typical primary ways to play retro games including PS. PS controllers are still set up this way today
* Select button on top left and start button on top right
* No guide button needed
* Android based so that it can be as small and light as possible
* Dedicated home button on bottom left and back button on bottom right
* High end (Snapdragon 8 Latest Gen Chip) chip
* 12gb RAM
* 64gb storage (mostly for the OS apps including emulators)
* Micro SD card (for ROMs)
* Game launcher as the default Android launcher (something like Daijisho)

I've chosen the Ayn Odin2 for me. While it does not have a top d-pad and is a little bit smaller than 7 inch screen, it is the closest I could find to meeting all my requirements above

**Type 4 - Game streaming:**

* ABXY button layout with maybe PS button layout printed on the Handheld face next to each button. This is because all games being streamed are either Xbox, PS or PC games
* D-pad below the left joystick (this may compromise PlayStation streamers though, but maybe PlayStation streamers will get PlayStation Portal anyway)
* View button on the top left and menu button on the top right
* Generic Guide button
* Android based so that it can be as small and light as possible
* Dedicated home button on bottom left and back button on bottom right
* Low end processor (MediaTek entry level)
* 4gb RAM
* 32gb storage
* Game launcher as the default Android Launcher and runs only one app at a time for purpose on keeping the device running for its sole purpose only (something like the Logitek G Cloud Game Mode Launcher)

I've chosen the Abxylute for me. While it does not have a dedicated back button, it meets all the other requirements.

**Finding one device to meet all 4 types of gaming:**

Now you may not want to buy a device for each type of gaming above and you may look for one device that can play all or majority of all the types of games in one.

If you don't mind compromising on button layout or dpad position or portability for any given type of gaming, you could just get a Windows handheld (maybe Asus ROG Ally) and be able to run all 4 types of games.

You could also combine type 2, 3 and 4 gaming, if you don't mind android and stream gaming with a BAYX button layout and with portrait android gaming being compromised.

Depending on which of the optimised features you are willing to compromise on, will determine which gaming types you can combine on a single device, but knowing the optimised features will help you know what you are compromising on if you choose to combine gaming types on any given device.",2,18uavx0,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/18uavx0/types_of_handheld_gaming_and_where_the_different/,1,2023-12-30 08:21:02,N/A,True,False,False,0.67,2,0

"[DEV] My first project : Idle / Incremental Pokemon inspired game, 6 months in !","Hi everyone !

First a few screenshots !

[Preview \(unfinished\) of the evolution animation](https://reddit.com/link/18eg1e4/video/elip3iaega5c1/player)

&#x200B;

I started learning unity in May, and slowly started making my own game to learn by doing, and it got pretty far !  
The gameplay is based on turn based 4v4 **AUTO** battles,  
You set your skillset before the fight, each monster can equip 4 skills ( Filler / Super / Hyper / Ultra ) Last 3 have a fixed rate, first one takes the remaining %, and each turn one skill is randomly chosen.  
Skills will be similar to most games, crowd control, damage over time, passive buffs, heals...

There is a playmode to catch monsters (finished and working). Called Safari (will rename it later), catching new monsters have random IV similar to Pokemon, all generated on the server, so no cheating possible here,

There are currently two worlds, Dawn Forest and Volcanic Area, and related monsters to catch in the respective Safaris,

There is a finished and working PvP mode (running on a server, so no cheating possible),

This month I am working hard to bring more skills to the game to make it more interesting, and I also still have to make a reward screen after battle and introduce a more in depth levelling / evolving system, for which I am still waiting for a little more feedback before I finish it.

The game is already available for testing on android (apk, still waiting for ID verification to put it in the google play store as a test) and iOS TestFlight (even if it doesn't matter much on this reddit haha).

If you are interested and want to test it, DO NOT expect deep gameplay and mechanics for now, there is only a basic levelling system (in monster menu), no evolution mechanic yet, and 9 available skills (that are not balanced yet, just the mechanic works), and since you can choose the preferred target of your monsters, you can just focus 1 and the outcome will just be based on if you can outspend enemy or not. Later there will be taunt skills, passive skills to reduce rate of being focused, passive skills that reduce damage when hit several times a turn and more... A lot is planned to make fight super interesting !

I also have a discord where I posted my daily progress over the last 4 months, previews for future content / future monsters, and where I also collect some feedback and try to build a mini community...

I estimate the game being 2/3 months away from release, so I hope I can manage to awake some interest in my project :D

Important notes :  
\- I am doing absolutely everything by myself next to my work and am a father, so sometimes progress is bit slower ( especially making good pixel art characters // scenes is hardcore ! But I am getting better, thanks AI for helping me turn my sketches into real designs xD)

\- The game is 100% free and will stay 100% free, and have 0 IAP that make you stronger ! There will be a few cosmetics later on that have absolutely no impact on the gameplay, but that's the last thing I will add once the entire game works perfectly. There will be ads that will not give any boost / rewards, just my eternal gratitude for helping me keeping the game running :)

A fun mobile game I found great for creativity and socializing,"\*\***DISCLAIMER! I am currently a moderator on Super Spatial's discord server. I did find the game on my own and I am no way endorsed by the developers to make this post. This is my doing since i love the game and want to see it thrive!**\*\*  


So about a year back I was scrolling through my instagram feed like I do and I found an ad for an upcoming game called Super Spatial. the game is available on IOS and Android currently. This game is a sandbox mmo almost like minecraft. You can craft blocks and build houses with them and decorate. You can also create islands to make mini games. The game has premade templates already made too for you to try out. I think its super fun! They have mini game templates similar to fall guys and overcooked and they allow you to edit the layout and create your own version with the blocks you can craft!

&#x200B;

On top of the game being this fun, the developers have some huge reputation behind them. All of the founders used to work on angry birds for the first part. Not to mention they actively listen to feedback and implant so many ideas the community creates. We get updates frequently too from the team and for the game. Everyone is so nice and kind and I can tell they put a ton of hard work and dedication into their project.

&#x200B;

The art style is kind of a cutesy cartoonish style. Very pleasing to the eye. The characters almost have like a bobble head like body. I find it super cute! I'll attach some images in this post.

Games that only use lower half of screen?,"Hi!

So my phone is broken so that only the bottom half of the screen works. This is fine for most applications because the iOS has an accessibility feature that lets you pull down the screen to within reach - but it only lasts a short amount of time and the bottom half is then instead not within reach

Which is really not a problem when what you wanna do is tap the “post”  button but a huge problem for mobile gaming

I’ve even noticed that not having games like 1010!, 2048 and whatever other kinda infinity puzzle games I used to play is even taking a toll on my mood; in the past when I needed a moment to kinda just sit and process my feelings I would play something like that

Nowadays I can’t so while I try to do mindfulness and look out the window or fidget etc, I fail at least 50% of time and end up scrolling social media or something

Anyone Able to Help Me Find An Old Game,"I'm trying to find an old app game that I had on my iPod touch sometime between 2009 and 2011 I believe.  It was a grid based, touch to move your party where you touch on the screen, pixelated RPG.  

Here are some details I vaguely believe I remember:

-Your main party member if I recall had blonde spiky final fantasy style hair.

-the very first area outside the first town spawned a lot of blue slime balls, they were faceless types of slimes just orbs

-there were a lot of party members in the game. by the end of the game I believe there was something like nearly 20 party members.

-also regarding party members there are parts in the game where you switch different areas to switch to a second party near the final act of the game the two parties combined together into one massive super party.

-the game had side quests that you got by talking to NPCs throughout each town area throughout the game story. a good amount of which were quests where you were to go kill a certain amount of an enemy types in a zone or at times kill a certain enemy type till they drop a rare drop key item.

-there was no combat window in this game you're just fighting enemies in the open world grid kind of like Pokemon mystery dungeon.

-the final zone outside the final boss is Castle or fortress was a dark brown grayish wasteland with enemies in it.

You could play on different maps. Two characters were father and daughter and I believe you could play as death itself, like the skeleton in a robe. One of the maps was a graveyard I believe.

The Surprising Benefits of Gaming: Beyond Entertainment,"Triobyte Gaming Blog 

In recent years, gaming has evolved from a mere form of entertainment to a multifaceted activity with a range of cognitive, social, and emotional benefits. While some may still view gaming as a recreational pastime, research suggests that engaging in video games can have positive impacts on various aspects of our lives.

1. Enhanced Cognitive Skills:
Contrary to the stereotype of gamers as sedentary individuals, gaming requires a high level of cognitive engagement. Many video games demand strategic thinking, problem-solving, and quick decision-making. Players often navigate complex virtual worlds, enhancing their spatial awareness, memory, and attention to detail.

2. Improved Coordination and Reflexes:
Fast-paced action games and simulations can improve hand-eye coordination and reflexes. Gamers develop fine motor skills as they navigate characters through intricate environments, contributing to better coordination in both virtual and real-world activities.

3. Social Interaction:
Online multiplayer games have transformed gaming into a social experience. Gamers can connect with friends or make new ones across the globe. Cooperative gameplay encourages teamwork and communication skills, fostering a sense of community among players.

4. Stress Relief and Relaxation:
Gaming serves as an effective stress-reliever for many individuals. Immersive gameplay provides an opportunity to escape the pressures of daily life, offering a virtual world where users can unwind and relax.

5. Educational Value:
Numerous games are designed with educational purposes in mind. From historical simulations to puzzle-solving adventures, these games engage players in learning experiences that can be both entertaining and informative.

6. Career Opportunities:
The gaming industry has burgeoned into a major economic force, offering diverse career opportunities beyond game development. Esports, streaming, and content creation have become viable professions, opening up new avenues for those passionate about gaming.

 7. Cultural Appreciation:
Story-driven games often explore rich narratives, diverse cultures, and historical contexts. Players gain exposure to different perspectives, fostering cultural appreciation and understanding.

While moderation is key, the benefits of gaming extend beyond pure entertainment. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, embracing the positive aspects of this diverse and dynamic medium can lead to a more holistic appreciation of its impact on individuals and society as a whole.",3,17r04r7,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/17r04r7/the_surprising_benefits_of_gaming_beyond/,1,2023-11-09 00:21:33,TriobyteGaming,True,False,False,1.0,3,0

Looking for Beta Testers for Mobile 4X Game Dominus,"**Hey Everyone!**

We're a small indie developer that are looking for a few people to try out a game we've had in the works!

As huge fans of games like *Civilization* and *Polytopia*, we've created our very own iteration of a 4x turn-based strategy banger that we call **Dominus**, but with a little twist...instead of consecutive turn based gameplay, we've decided to go with simultaneous turns. The end result is a cerebral game of 4D Chess where you have to out-think your opponents with every move you make, because they'll be doing the exact same thing to you!

We'd be extremely grateful for anyone that would be interested in giving **Dominus** a shot and helping this little studio achieve its dreams of giving strategy gamers a fresh new take on the genre!

Looking for a game to replace Diablo Immortal,"So for a while I've been loving D:I despite being massively p2w the honeymoon phase has come to an end.

While I knew about most of the problems going my genuine love for progression / live service games and the Gamba / gatcha aspects managed to fully sink their teeth into me.

However eventually the insane restrictions got to me, as someone who spends on games but isn't a swiper / whale the game straight up restricts me from accessing certain mechanics. No swipe? no crests and a hard weekly cap on dust to gamble with.

So I gave up, if the game won't accept my 25-50 quid as a reasonable thing to spend a month I'm out

But now I've got to find something else, I'm looking for a multiplayer/ live service game that I can sink a LOT of time into. But with how awful the play store is I've been unable to find anything interesting looking.

My criteria/ what I'm hoping to find.

RPG / upgrade or progression systems at the forefront.
(That is the big requirement)

Action based rather than turn based

Social game rather than single player

P2w is fine as long as a f2p / modest spender can grind as an alternative, hard caps / energy systems are a no-go

Love gatcha mechanics / collection games but not a big fan of ""roster"" games where you've got multiple characters to manage, that's why I loved D:I

Not a week so while I don't mind anime games they're not my faves.

A pc client as well would be a mega bonus 

For reference, my favourite games are RuneScape (both versions) diablo (any of them) Destiny 2 (Rip) and Division 2

Would a ps3/xbox 360 emulator be possible?,"You might think ""Ah, but not even aetherx2 runs directly on cell phones these days""

The answer is simple, Aethersx2 is not fully optimized, take ppspp for example, which can run gow in high quality without heating up or experiencing large fps drops, I know that the psp is weaker than the Ps2, But it's something to consider, a little more optimization in aethersx and the app would be perfect

But my point in the post is not to talk about aetherx2, but rather to discuss whether it would be possible to run PS3/Xbox360 games on cell phones. Ps3 for example has 256mb of ram, while today's cell phones They have at least 4GB of RAM, I know that RAM isn't everything when it comes to running a game, but that's something very important, another important thing is the processors, (I know snap 888 is very powerful but it's just an example).

The point I want to get to is whether, with a lot of optimization, it would be possible for this dream to become a reality.

Any help would be appreciated 🙏,3,17ewheq,MobileGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/MobileGaming/comments/17ewheq/i_need_help_with_finding_a_game_i_used_to_play_as/,1,2023-10-23 22:02:24,N/A,True,False,False,1.0,3,0

Looking for an old Digging/Drilling game,"As said in the Title, I'm looking for a drilling/digging game, a mobile game ( and an old one at that ) Where you were controlling a Drilling machine that was dropped from a platform into the ground and them you would start digging down. You controlled it by sliding your finger from left ro right. Gameplay-wise you would just avoid obstacles I thinkm Sometimes there would be these rails that you had to ride and switch in between if some were broken or cut off and eventually there would also be some huge worm that would chase you once and a while. The game was 2d and I think you could even upgrade the machine.
Pleae tell me if you at least remember playing a game like that. It was fun and I'd like to revisit it for some nostalgia.

Looking for pixel game recommendations,"Anyone got any good game recommendations that are pixel graphics and decent to play? I'd prefer multiplayer.

Games I've played are Orna, Aethric, Maplestory and Bit heroes. I liked bit heroes but it got p2w where I was at it was a huge wall and stopped progression. I maxed in Aethric and got bored of class balance.
