"Reddit API Changes, Subreddit Blackout & Why It Matters To You","Greetings r/pcgaming,

Recently, Reddit has announced some [changes to their API](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/) that may have pretty serious impact on many of it's users.

[You may have already seen quite a few posts like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) across some of the other subreddits that you browse, so we're just going to cut to the chase.

# What's Happening

* Third Party Reddit apps (such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun and others) are going to become ludicrously more expensive for it's developers to run, which will in turn either kill the apps, or result in a monthly fee to the users if they choose to use one of those apps to browse. Put simply, each request to Reddit within these mobile apps will cost the developer money. The developers of Apollo [were quoted around $2 million per month](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) for the current rate of usage. The only way for these apps to continue to be viable for the developer is if you (the user) pay a monthly fee, and realistically, this is most likely going to just outright kill them. **Put simply: If you use a third party app to browse Reddit, you will most likely no longer be able to do so, or be charged a monthly fee to keep it viable.**

  * A big reason this matters to r/pcgaming, and why we believe it matters to you, is that during our last user demographics survey, [of 2,500 responses, 22.4% of users say they primarily use a third party app to browse the subreddit](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482367144101806090/1114653103925514410/image.png). Using this as sort of a sample size, even significantly reduced, is a non-negligible portion of our user base being forced to change the way they browse Reddit.

  * Some people with visual impairments have problems using the official mobile app, and the removal of third-party apps may significantly hinder their ability to browse Reddit in general. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/)

  * Many moderators are going to be significantly hindered from moderating their communities because 3rd party mobile apps provide mod tools that the official app doesn't support. This means longer wait times on post approvals, reports, modmails etc.

* NSFW Content is no longer going to be available in the API. This means that, even if 3rd party apps continue to survive, or even if you pay a fee to use a 3rd party app, you will not be able to access NSFW content on it. You will only be able to access it on the official Reddit app. Additionally, some service bots (such as video downloaders or maybe remindme bots) will not be able to access anything NSFW. In more major cases, it may become harder for moderators of NSFW subreddits to combat serious violations such as CSAM due to certain mod tools being restricted from accessing NSFW content.

Note: A lot of this has been sourced and inspired from a fantastic mod-post on r/wow, they do a great job going in-depth on the entire situation. Major props to the team over there! [You can read their post here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/13ymdue/reddit_api_changes_subreddit_blackouts_and_you/)

# Open Letter to Reddit & Blackout

In lieu of what's happening above, [an open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) has been released by the broader moderation community, and r/pcgaming will be supporting it.

Part of this initiative includes a potential subreddit blackout (meaning, the subreddit will be privatized) on June 12th, lasting 24-48 hours or longer. On one hand, this is great to hopefully make enough of an impact to influence Reddit to change their minds on this. On the other hand, we usually stay out of these blackouts, and we would rather not negatively impact usage of the subreddit, especially during the summer events cycle. If we chose to black out for 24 hours, on June 12th, that is the date of the Ubisoft Forward showcase event. If we chose to blackout for 48 hours, the subreddit would also be private during the Xbox Extended Showcase. 

We would like to give the community a voice in this. Is this an important enough matter that r/pcgaming should fully support the protest and blackout the subreddit for at least 24 hours on June 12th? How long if we do? Feel free to leave your thoughts and opinions below. 

Cheers,

r/pcgaming Mod Team

------------------------------------------------------------

UPDATE 6/9 8am: As of right now, due to overwhelming community support, we are planning on continuing with the blackout on June 12th. Today there will be an AMA with /u/spez and that will determine our course. We'll keep you all updated as get more info.

The steam awards show exactly why gamers can't be responsible to actually hand out awards.,"Every year we hear complaints that the official GOTY awards show gets it wrong with how they hand out awards. Every year we hear gamers lament  that those awards 'don't mean anything because they don't reflect what gamers choose aside from the gamers choice award'.

Well... this year RDR 2 is voted as labor of love and starfield as 'innovative'.

These are clearly 'troll' votes and memes, but many studios actually DO value these awards.

When game awards are handed out and controlled entirely by uninvested gamers the awards become jokes.

&#x200B;

It really is a shame because these awards are probably the second best way to show what the community as a whole values and what it doesn't, aside from 'voting with your wallet' of course.

After this showing this year, I now place more value on the GOTY awards show than anything the steam awards presents. Just filled with trolls that ruin the entire idea.

Diablo 4 loses 87% of its daily peak viewership and search interest since launch,"From 937k peak viewers at launch, to 12.2k peak viewers today. Now, had Diablo 4 been a single player game, this would have been completely fine. However, Diablo 4 is a live service which launched in a pretty half baked state and season 1, which many hoped would fix many of these issues present since launch less than **3 weeks ago.**

This season was supposed to last 3 months and its gone from 278k -> 12.2k in less than 3 weeks. Ironically, both viewership and search interest declined by the exact same amount, 87%, not ideal for a live service offering.

Personally, I've lost most of my interest in the game after the massive nerfs in season 1 and I felt that the new powers in season 1 just did not do enough to compensate.

Rockstar is Incompetent,"So just to start out, Rockstar has the worst customer support and account security I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. I've been in Limbo for six months trying to recover my rockstar account. They allowed someone to change my email, password, to apply a 2fa, all without giving me any form of notification of said actions.  


Fast forward six months and about fifteen support tickets and as of this morning still no help. So finally I screen shotted every single conversation I've had with Rockstar and sent them to Steam via a support ticket. Steam was very respectful and very helpful to an extent.   


Steam contacted Rockstar and provided basically the same information I did but from their end. Rockstar's reply was appalling.  They said they weren't sure if it was actually Steam trying to contact them. Steam said I should seek legal action.   


So today I called up a Lawyer that my construction company does work for. He wrote up a document that stated he would submit a subpoena if they did not recover my account.  Within three hours of sending the customer support of Rockstar the letter, the rockstar account was unlinked from steam.   


Thats literally all I wanted. Was for them to unlink the account associated with my steam. So basically, what I'm trying to tell you guys is Rockstar is the lowest of the low when it comes to customer support.

"To Reviewers: Performance, Stability & Fluidity Should Be Part of the Final Score. Not a Side Note!","This was the case decades ago and somehow reviewers just review one port, consoles usually, then blanket the score the highest score across all platforms. If you don't have multiple systems (2-3 systems) to check and test PC Games, don't review PC games. It is unethical, not reflective and pure laziness. Regardless of platform, performance should be part of the final review. You review the code you have! Not the promise of the developer putting out a day 0/1 patch. Devs/Publishers should be ready to take a hit with a poor review if they keep doing these lazy and shady practices. It isn't just that we vote with our wallets as gamers, reviewers have a responsibility too or otherwise you are part of the problem.

So for example jedi Survivor should be something like this: PS5 = 7, Xbox = 7, PC = 4. Not the blanket of 8s and 9s everyone is throwing. I know reviewers support devs and try hard to avoid giving bad reviews but all you are doing is basically theft from your readers.

For those reviewers who don't score, don't recommend the game. (Most of you that I follow do that already).


Edit: Thank you for the great response. I sat here for a couple of hours responding to many of the discussions here. I hope this gains attention from reviewers across the industry and even further, developers and publishers.",4333,133lp5c,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/133lp5c/to_reviewers_performance_stability_fluidity/,489,2023-04-30 10:31:07,MNB4800,True,False,False,0.93,4333,0

But hey, he streamed my game!

He also managed to find a small bug that I have never seen before or can replicate now , uh oh.

I got around 30 purchases when he started streaming then got 20 refunds. I am assuming this is the people who only bought the game to stream snipe.

So yes, I think a very large streamer playing the game did more harm than good.

"Baldur's gate 3 peaks at 818k concurrent players in its opening weekend, making it the most popular CRPG/Turn based game on steam by a considerable margin","So not only is BG3 now the highest CCU CRPG (which itself is a niche genre), but it is also the highest CCU turn based game by a considerable margin. Overall, its the #9 highest CCU in all of steam records.

If considering all turn based games:

**#9 Baldur's gate - 818k**

\#48 Dota Underlords - 202k (whether you consider this turn based is up to you)

\#68 Civ 6 - 162k

\#86 XCOM2 - 133k

If considering only CRPGs:

**#9 Baldur's gate - 818k**

\#86 XCOM2 - 133k (Highly debatable if this is a CRPG, feel free to discount this if you want)

\#137 Divinity Original Sin 2 - 93k

Why do new games only look about 5-15% better than games from 5 years ago yet they are 50-100% more demanding on hardware?,"The title says it all. I am wondering whether this is about devs being lazy with optimization or something entirely different. Games like Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA 5, Rainbow Six Siege, and alike look fantastic but can be run on older cards with high settings easily whereas newer games struggle to run on high even with newer cards. Take Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018) vs. Remmenant 2 (2023), the latter looks only slightly better than the former but is much more demanding.

I apologize if I am missing something or look completely stupid but I am just curious as to what people think the reasoning is.

Edit: Look at many UE5 games, they don't even look that much better on UE5 but are so much more demanding!  


Edit: As many people have pointed out, some older games with ultra graphics run better and also look better than newer games with medium graphics!",3689,1686m1l,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1686m1l/why_do_new_games_only_look_about_515_better_than/,1119,2023-09-02 16:17:59,UMAYEERIBN,True,False,False,0.87,3689,0

Single Player games that relies on Internet Connection (always online) to combat Piracy must've been the most pathetic and anti-consumerism decision ever made by game companies,"The Crew is a Racing game that the whole portion of Single Player content can be played ""offline"". Last month, Ubisoft announced that The Crew is shutting down next year on March 2024. Rendering the game unplayable, both the single player and multiplayer content. This is similar to what happened with 2K's Battleborne.

[Accused Farm](https://youtu.be/8KZwcHOSRgQ?si=7iu9xawCoaydSk-7) made a great point about GaaS is a huge scam and fraud business made by publishers and stockholders/shareholders. He also called out that The Crew's requiring Constant Internet Connection with having **no live-service content or elements** on it has been proven that publishers dont want pirates to crack their games that can be playable offline. So Ubisoft made sure that they coded The Crew's architecture to be designed and playable always online. Basically impossible for crack groups to crack the game. As of now, the game hasn't been cracked since 2014, that's 9 years uncrackable.

Remember that you are giving them money for license, not own it. This is the reason why subscription based models like Xbox Game Pass is currently booming.

[Going Indie](https://youtu.be/OimLa85tE4M?si=rVnMtzZdpLleiMtG) also made a great point about the current state of owning a game(or in this case any product). The future of gaming and owning a ""digital"" product is looking bleak and not great.

Is Baldur's Gate 3 THAT Good?,"Obviously there's a ton of hype around this game right now. Never played a D&D style cRPG, aside from I guess sort a Dragon Age Origins.

Is this game really that good for those of you that have played it? 

For instance, my first Souls game was Bloodborne and the experience of playing that at the time was absolutely mind blowing and unforgettable. Same goes for Super Metroid, ME1, Arkham Asylum. 

Is it that kind of feeling where you feel like your engaged in a once in a lifetime experience (as far as first video game play through go)?

EDIT: Appreciate all the answers. Based on what I'm reading, the majority indicates it's one of those games. I'm definitely going to end up trying it once I finish Elden Ring, since Warhammer 3 dlc is price gouging and Starfield looks a little meh to me.

"Remember ""RuneScape""? Every original version of the game is lost. But if you have any old computers or hard drives you played it on, you probably have a missing version","Hi all, you might have seen the previous thread about this. But since it's been a year we thought it was worth asking again.

RuneScape is a free browser MMORPG that became quite popular during the 2000s. Unfortunately the game's developers did not keep any full backups until 2012, except two copies from 2003 and 2007. Every other version of the game is missing.

However, if you ever played the game, even just once for a few minutes, the full files would be downloaded and saved on your computer. It would be great if people here would be willing to help search for copies of this lost game.

We've managed to recover quite a lot of old versions from people checking their computers in this way, but we still have almost nothing from 2005 or earlier.

We made an [**open source search tool**](https://github.com/edward4096/rscachefinder/releases) here that will automatically find all the relevant files. However if you want to search manually yourself, the directory names were:

*  **C:\WINDOWS\\.file_store_32**
*  **C:\WINDOWS\\.jagex_cache_32**

To clarify, these files don't contain any personal/account details whatsoever, it's just the game's assets.

Thanks in advance!",2770,18p6ufp,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/18p6ufp/remember_runescape_every_original_version_of_the/,211,2023-12-23 14:30:46,Hlwys,True,False,False,0.96,2770,0

Bethesda has implemented a mod marketplace into Skyrim.,"Today Skyrim Special Edition received a new update, from 1.6.640 to 1.6.1130.

With it the ""Mods"" and ""Creations"" menu were consolidated into a new UI and paid mods are back, the new UI also lets you organize your load order and browse free mods which was already possible before.

The update also added a new resource pack (I assume these are ""free for modders to use"") and broke SKSE-related mods, the paid mods seems to be only from ""recognised"" mod authors like TrainWiz who worked previously in the CC, and you might know him from the Thomas the Tank mod back in 2011.

Note that this only affects the Steam version of the game, the GOG version has no in-game modding menu or creation club because it was stripped from all online functionality.

[Some Screenshots Here](https://imgur.com/a/RZhUvOI)

Here's a list of the creations that you can buy in this marketplace.

* [East Empire Expansions](https://youtu.be/FXGNyokX3A4) - 700 Credits [Quest Mod/Service/Expansion Mod]
* Winterfrost Plus Edition - 600 Credits [House Mod]

Every PC gamer needs to know their monitor colors are limited by default in windows,"by default windows10 sets your monitor output range to limited. Even if you have a GTX4090 it will be set on limited by default.

Instead of using full color range of 0-255 it uses 16-235. so 14% less colors overall

right click desktop - nvidia control panel - click change resolution on the left side - scroll down a bit and click USE NVIDIA SETTINGS. Then change output range from limited to full.

Its like the difference between 720p and 1080p.. but instead of pixels..colors. Everyone who has every tried this adds me on steam and tries to be me friend for the rest of their life

Even people who are computer mechanics and stuff and think they know everything are shocked by this change as well. Trust me. Just try it. If you dont like it you can change it right back

windows does this on the off-chance someone plugs in a 30yr old monitor,

I have never used a piece of software worse than the EA app. I feel like I'm going to a restaurant just to get a plate with nothing on it.,"Everybody hates game launchers, that's just a fact. But holy fuck, at least when I'm forced to use [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), Uplay, Rockstar's launcher, Epic, or Steam I can at least expect them to launch the game 100% of the time. Off the top of my head I can never recall a single instance of any of those launchers failing to launch a game. 

But then here comes the EA app. Getting this piece of shit to actually launch a game, **the main thing a game launcher is supposed to do**, is like getting a drunk dead-beat father with three ex-wives in his thirties to pay child support. I get that it's EA, I get that their primary focus was getting the store portion of the launcher to function, but this is like if Ford made a car that couldn't drive. It's a game launcher, there is absolutely no reason why it shouldn't be able to launch a game, yet here we are. I straight up can't play the games that I paid real money for because this app is like a printer that's ""low on ink"".

Doesn't the success of Helldivers 2 tell Sony that the only reason their previous ports had mediocre sales is because they were ported years later?,"Helldivers is an ok game at best that doesn't even have single-player, yet it has better Steam sales than any previous Sony port because it actually came out day 1 rather than in the shape of hand me downs 2-4+ years after the initial console launch.

Most of the previous ports range from high 8s to 9s and are amazing games, but they barely get any sales compared to AAA Steam launches. They sell like 20 mil copies on PlayStation, and then 1 million on PC because Sony is still treating PC like a random side project. Why is there still no Bloodborne, Demon Souls, Ghost of Tsushima, or smaller ones like Shadow of Colossus, Last Guardian, and all the other games that are over 6 years old with no word on an eventual port? 

I know they want to keep the timed exclusivity to justify the console's existence, but porting games so late and so randomly doesn't make sense to me just like how never porting games to PC prior to HZD made no sense to me back then. These ports come out like wet farts that lose relevance and hype (and sales) within a week, because that's how Sony is treating them.",1671,1aqoe38,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1aqoe38/doesnt_the_success_of_helldivers_2_tell_sony_that/,668,2024-02-14 14:38:54,Bobakmrmot,True,False,False,0.76,1671,0

Modded Cyberpunk 2077 might be one of the most immersive sim experiences in gaming.,"I played the game back when it released and just recently I decided to check the mod scene to see what people have created and I am amazed at the quality of some of the mods and how they change how you experience Night City.

There are mods that make super complicated things that you don't even expect CD Project Red to be able to do it at this point like being able to pull your gun while driving, flying with your car in a super realistic way, redesign of core mechanics of the game like the slow motion allowing you to deflect bullets with your katana and the list goes on and on.

But to me the greatest mods are those that immerse you in the city even more, I currently have 60 mods installed and 90% of them serve this purpose, after modding the shit out of the game now I have fully functional metro system with customized stations all over the city, all street food vendors are interactable now and you can buy from them so they are not just part of the aesthetics of the map, I have custom animations for eating except of selecting an item from the menu and clicking ""eat"", I can analyze each pedestrian with my Kyroshy eye Cyberware in real time I will get procedural generated life information about each pedestrian that will make sense in relation to what they are wearing and in which are are they live, I can buy new cars from my apartments PC, I live in a Mansion in the top of a skyscraper with fully functional mechannichs like any other official home, I have improved vehicle handling inmensly, I have increased the number of pedestrians and traffic by double making the city look super alive and massive etc....

I have just named a few out of hundreds and hundreds of top notch mods that i keep discovering and everyday there is something new. Do you know when you love a game and devs are realising new content very often and you are super excited to check whats new and jump in again? well this feels the same but t a huge speed and you choose what you want in your game.

If you are the kind of gamer that enjoys just walking around in your horse in Red Dead Redemption 2 and just role play for a bit, you really have to experience modded Cyberpunk and you will be amazed at how immerse you will be in this world.

Edit: I have made a quick video of my downloaded mod list but not all of them are here: [here is the video](https://streamable.com/6sl1m0)

Edi 2: I have uploaded the mod collection here is the link: https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/r7bway take into account that there are some adult mods also included, you know... for the immersion.

Edit 3: I made a super cringy video (https://youtu.be/NaQj7U_-mNU) with my terrible English voice over showing some of them but after revisiting it I realized I left out so many like the mansion for V for example which would have been perfect for the video but here is the link for that one mod you really have to check that one out it is badass: https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5437 (If the video looks like crap wait for YouTube to upload it to 4k in a couple hours)

"PureDark trying to justify DRM. Claim's it's a ""win-win"" for his subscribers.","Context: PureDark is the author of the DLSS 3 Mods for various games (most recently Starfield). He recently added an authentication DRM to his recent uploads.

Quote from PureDark on Patreon:

&#x200B;

>Whoever says I was forcing a monthly subscription to use the mods is totally wrong and they did not even bother to read the posts.  
>  
>I have stated in every post since I first added DRM that no subscribers will be affected, you can literally cancel subscription and wait a year then pass the authentication from another computer to get the token with your account whose subscription expired for one year, it's written in every posts on patreon since I added it.  
>  
>DRM is obviously bad for reputation since a lot of people keep demonizing what I did.  
>  
>When implemented well this could've been a good thing for subscribers, since with DRM I can stop restricting download acceess with roles.  
>  
>And it also allows for free updates for former subscribers.  
>  
>For example if a mod still fails after a game update despite the memory signature I used, I can simply update it and release it, and people who subscribed for only one month for this mod back when the game was released, can now get the update I release for free without having to resub, but people who didn't subscribe still can't use it even if they can download it.  
>  
>It's literally a win-win, only loser is pirates. But since all the hypocrite have to go againist me while still finding every way they can to use my mods, I'll continue to make it harder for them.  
>  
>I am about to move on from Starfield to next game, I'll continue this as a service no matter what they said.

Companies removing the original games from Steam after releasing remasters,"What does everyone think about it? Why do publishers do that? It doesn't make any sense. I get that remasters are quick cash grabs and they want you to buy them instead of the original, but why not give us the original too as a bonus (as some publishers do)?

There are countless examples of this bullshit: Metro 2033, Metro Last Light, GTA 3/Vice City/San Andreas Definitive Edition, Dead Island, Dead Island Riptide, Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition

Am I the only one who hates it? Everytime I see someone complaining about it on Steam forums people get confused as to why would they want ""an inferior product"". The keys for those original games are being resold sold for a lot of money after the removal, so clearly there's a demand for those.

I have an older PC that I'm fine with and want to play older games on it. Is it too much to ask of publishers to take my money so I can purchase a game I could actually run?

I remember the times when piracy was rampant and one of the main selling point of platforms like Steam was quality, availability and convenience. Oh how they times have changed. It's like they're artificially creating abandonware

Outriders manipulating Steam reviews and false marketing—the release date of the game changed from 2021 to 2024,"**PREFACE EDIT:**

So, I took an L here, and I decided to post this on top of the original post so new (maybe even old) Redditors would see it.  


I realized after looking at **Grand Theft Auto IV Complete Edition's** *SteamDB* page that despite not using a new store page, its original release date (**2008**) also changed (**2020**) when they removed the game package with the original release date and replaced it with a package (complete edition) with the new release date. This is why **Wo Long Fallen Dynasty** still has a release date of the 7th of Feb, 2024, despite the game coming out last year and I think won't be corrected. However, **Outriders** was a bit different as it offered the purchase of the base game as well, not just the Complete Edition. But this isn't something you see with other games that offer a ""Complete Edition"", like most recently **Resident Evil 4 Remake's** ***Gold Edition,*** so I immediately assumed the worst.

Still, even if I can't bring myself to give big gaming companies the benefit of the doubt when I see stuff like this that they can potentially abuse to earn more money given all the stuff I see them already do *(we have SEGA selling us NG+ as DLC, which still can't beat Konami's pay us for a save slot shtick in Metal Gear Survive)*, I should have. It's what I want to, and should, act like. I should have offered more than just my view on things and shouldn't have made it seem **(especially in the title of the post)** as an unrefutable thing. It may be that they saw this could be done and wanted to do what I accused them of, or perhaps they didn't know this would happen, and it was a simple mistake.

So, while I still think it's scummy having a game that saw its **last content update in June 2022** now being promoted as a new game (or rather was promoted until they changed it back), **I** **shouldn't have pushed my own view on others as the ultimate truth** and instead should have made it clear that **I** think this is potentially something shady but that there is a possibility it isn't and that I might have just gotten myself a nice tinfoil hat.

*We all make mistakes in the heat of passion, my Jimbos.*

&#x200B;

**Original Post:**

Someone, the devs or Square Enix, is manipulating the Steam reviews of Outriders by changing the release date of the game to the 8th of Feb 2024. Now there are reviews tagged as ""Pre-Release"", which they are simply not. The game was released as a full game, with no Early Access talk or such, in 2021 which you can see on SteamDB.

[Outriders ""new"" release date](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Faztdrxzcfkhc1.png%3Fwidth%3D969%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Da04a5ec16a5ec21ccfcaa8725d9ad8d250bd7a27)

[Outriders actual release date](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Ftmmx7z8kgkhc1.png%3Fwidth%3D970%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De3ca32c818b4a548ed6e0c6e3d1a12c82a9483bf)

[Reviews pre Complete Edition release now tagged as Pre-Release](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fxm07smulgkhc1.png%3Fwidth%3D977%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Def230db59b626c94bb5b275581a3754ae19db803)

This seems like a really scummy thing to do, marketing it as some sort of new game to unaware players. The last bit of the game's content was released in June 2022. This lying done just bc they chose to release a ""Complete Edition"" version of the game needs to stop. Perhaps Capcom should also ""fix"" their release date for Resident Evil 4 Remake to the 9th of Feb 2024 since that's when the Gold Edition (aka Complete Edition) was released.

**EDIT:** Thanks u/ChristopherKlay for pointing out the changelog page on SteamDB for the game. I forgot it had a section to see this kind of changes done to the game. For the curious, here is the [SteamDB changelog entry](https://steamdb.info/app/680420/history/?changeid=U:45164941) that shows the date was changed. And if you think this doesn't matter, the game now shows up in the **New Releases** section as if it were an actual newly released game.

Also, another game that did this (and seems to be the first of the two) is Wo Long Fallen Dynasty. Here's the [SteamDB changelog for it](https://steamdb.info/app/1448440/history/?changeid=U:45124991). It just got a Complete Edition as well.

**EDIT 2**: Outriders now has the correct release date; Wo Long still doesn't. Still not 100% sure if devs/publishers can manually change their release date after release like they can before release (up to two weeks before the release date previously set) without needing Valve's permission. They did release the Complete Editions of the game, but the store pages weren't new (like say with GTA IV Complete Edition) so why did their release date change, and how? Can devs/pub change the date on the store page as they please? If so, that may lead to some serious issues with the new release tab being exploited.

**EDIT 3:** Some extra info, again from u/ChristopherKlay (a man more helpful than Steam Support):

1. Steam isn't changing the release date of store entries that have a new version on it's own, no. These changes (together with uploading new assets like screenshots or the store logo) have been made / requested by the devs.
2. Steam only allows you to change the release date of a store entry if it's more than 2 weeks in the future. If you need to change the date after it's initial release, you need to contact Valve.
3. In some cases, there's been issues due to two different ""release dates"". `common_steam_release_date` describes the release on Steam, while `common_original_release_date` describes the release date of the game itself. Some games feature both, Outriders for example only has a set `common_steam_release_date`. By default, this is simply set to the day the game is released on Steam.
4. Adding a steam entry to a package (like a complete edition, or adding a DLC to something) doesn't automatically update the release date of the entry itself.",1186,1amp962,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1amp962/outriders_manipulating_steam_reviews_and_false/,118,2024-02-09 14:22:46,Sv_Prolivije,True,False,False,0.91,1186,0

Modern Aim Assist is ruining competitive fps games for mouse and keyboard players... (unpopular opinion),"So.... I am an enjoyer of COD games in the past, and finally had to uninstall MW2 to to constantly having my account put under review do to ""multiple reports of 'hacking' "". My account is reinstated after a week about each time due to the fact that i do not cheat, but play on mouse and keyboard.  I just played the mw3 beta on PS5 for about 3 hours on controller, and low and behold the rotational aim assist fully tracks targets across the screen, has snap-to adjustments, as well as speed matching. i am terrible on controller yet can fully track a target thats 75 meters from me no problem? When are people gonna chill with the copium and stop being okay with that level of auto-tracking in a competitive title? The aim assist in Xdefiant was the same for the cross-play beta, so much so that they have said they are going to introduce input based matchmaking at launch. In Battlefield 2042, the weapons have monstrously less recoil when playing with a controller, and the addition of rotational aim assist to help with ""accessibility""? what?... the idea that you cant become good at aiming on a controller is a farce, there are controller pros on pubg and apex alike with amazing tracking and not being carried by an auto aim mechanic. Go watch Nicewigg go into Master and Pred lobbies and dominate in Apex on a gamecube controller with severely reduced AA on PC. practice makes perfect.

if they have to start introducing auto aim mechanics for people who play on a controller, so they can compete with average mnk players, why is it that they even have them together in the first place? Its just as easy to create an input based matchmaking system so that Im not forced to play Apex, CS2 and PUBG over the other movement shooters i genuinely enjoy. I seriously enjoyed MW2019  but the SBMM forces me to play strictly against people who play on controller, and even most people on PC are on a controller due to mouse being ""too hard"".. yet when MW2 comes out they nerf all movement mechanics to create a ""fairer playing field"". Like wtf are people on, these are COMPETETIVE GAMES, they are not meant to create handholding for individuals who cant take the time to practice aim. I Literally have to play hours of Aimlabs to just be able to compete in my cod lobbies, and still die in ways that are very easily unfair to people who actually have no clue whats going on. The aim assist will grab on and follow just enough for their reaction time to catch up, make micro adjustments to strafe match players, and pull the screen 180 degrees to match my speed as i jump strafe around my target. What has to happen for people to realize this is a serious issue, so people can take the steps to create a better environment for mouse players?

The links provided are all serious examples of how this mechanic hurts FPS games as a whole, and takes away from any skill gap that makes good MNK players actually have a fun time..

BG3 - [Patch #6.0 - Known Bugs/Issues](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdFn2wkDh_JfE9rpEyp2sooyh6Qoaz6MthxmYvR9-AQ/edit)

&nbsp;

**A personal note from Peach:**
Patch 6.0 is by far the most broken the game has been since I can remember. I started playing when it was in version 2.0. Almost everything that has been added and listed in the patch notes released in a broken state, not to mention that these new features broke other parts of the game, ones that previously worked without any issue.

I do not claim to understand just how much this was playtested before release, but if I can come across most of these bugs in the first hour of my playthrough, Larian should also be able to, especially with how much more resources they hold.

I like Larian but this patch is a travesty. I am sure it was pushed with good intentions, but if I could, I would throw out all of the 6.0 features and revert to 5.0 in a heartbeat.
Please do not throw the good name of this game into the trash by pushing half baked updates like this, I am very disappointed and sad about the state of the game in 6.0.

I would much rather you push back a patch by a week, or even two, as long as it results in a better experience for your players, one without major issues.

I have faith in you guys and I absolutely adore your game.

June 12th Subreddit Blackout Update,"tl;dr: We're blacking out on June 12th for at least 48 hours. Read on for more info.

Good morning /r/pcgaming,

A few days ago we [posted a notice](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/140qajt/reddit_api_changes_subreddit_blackout_why_it/) regarding the upcoming [API changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/). In that post, we asked for the community's support to blackout following [an open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) that was posted rallying subreddit's mod teams to support opposition of the change.

Since that notice, not only did we receive overwhelming support in favor of blacking out, things have also [escalated](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/), and Reddit has largely just [doubled down](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/) on the changes. Third party apps [continue](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/jnk4oz4/?context=5) to be [vilified](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/145bzus/ceo_spez_ama_overview/) by Reddit staff.

Long story short: Reddit [hasn't addressed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/145l7wp/todays_ama_with_spez_did_nothing_to_alleviate/) the main concerns we've brought before them. As such, we've decided to continue on with the planned 48 hour blackout on June 12th alongside the 3000+ subreddits already participating.

We don't make this decision lightly. We love this subreddit, the news and information it brings you, and all of the members that participate to make this place what it is. We understand that this is a disruption but that is the point of a protest. Once the 48 hours are up we will re-open, reassess and see if further action is warranted. We're hopeful that Reddit will quickly come to its senses when faced with the prospect of losing some of its top subreddits.

## What you can do to help

* **Don't use Reddit during the blackout time** - Don't open the app or visit the site, even once. Make their daily active user metric tank and show them that you're serious.

  * Consider using a plug-in like [BlockSite](https://blocksite.co/) (h/t /u/GameStunts) to prevent you from, out of habit, opening up Reddit. You can still turn it off and override it but it's simply a self-control measure.

  * If you want to keep up with PC Gaming news, join the r/pcgaming Discord [here](https://discord.gg/4bxJgkY). We promise not to @everybody too much.

* **Complain. Make your voice heard.** - Respectfully message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a support request: comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/) post. 

* The most important part: **Remain respectful at all times,** avoid profanity and attacks on Reddit staff and their support team. The people reading these messages and complaints are humans, too.",1122,1461ezq,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1461ezq/june_12th_subreddit_blackout_update/,168,2023-06-10 14:16:35,PCGamingMegaMod,True,False,False,0.91,1122,0

I wish there were more AAA corridor story driven fps shooters coming these days.,"You know what i mean, games like half life, doom, bioshock wolfenstein etc. 15 hour campaigns with great replayability and cool set pieces, arsenal of weapons thats set in stone and focus on the story is what i would hope for from modern fps games. Instead everything is turning into massive open world rpg's or immersive sim or coop action. Even atomic heart which came out recently still has those elements. 

Personally i'm not a fan of this semi-open world thing which also started to invade almost every genre of videogames where it's still technically a corridor experience but is pretentious enough to pass as open world for some people. I would rather play games that focus on the main path and dont let you stray too much from the main plot. However it seems like there's so few games like that coming out these days. Only game i can think of is system shock but even that is just a remake of old game. I would like to see some new stuff but it seems i have no luck.",1077,15g50jw,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/15g50jw/i_wish_there_were_more_aaa_corridor_story_driven/,327,2023-08-02 10:16:23,Wooden_Sherbert6884,True,False,False,0.87,1077,0

Hi-Fi Rush is the most solid PC Port of 2023 among a slew of poor quality ones; it is also the least sold.,"I was watching Digital Foundry's podcast with Alex claiming that Hi-Fi Rush is the only PC port he played in 2023 that is solid in a play and forget manner and I agree. No stutter, no VRAM concerns, highly scalable and with most modern options like DLSS, Nvidia Reflex and ultrawide. It is a truly great PC port, despite being an Unreal Engine title, and they even went on about how [they spent extra time and effort eliminating stutter](https://www.pcgamer.com/hi-fi-rush-is-proof-that-unreal-engine-games-can-be-gloriously-stutter-free/).

However, I was surprised to see it is very likely the least sold, with **only 13,193 Steam reviews** to accompany it.

In comparison: 

* **Hogwarts Legacy**, struggling with VRAM and performance issues has **141,832 reviews**
* **Dead Space**, which still hasn't fixed stutter and LOD issues has **22,235 reviews**
* **The Last of Us**, which is barely functional except for high-end cards, has **17,039 reviews**
* **Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty** also has a slew of issues but has **16,077 reviews**

These games also sold for **60 to 70 dollars**, whereas Hi-Fi Rush, despite being a polished 12-hours experience, only sold for **30 dollars**. The game is also on Game Pass, but so is Wo Long, which still enjoys a bigger rate of reviews on Steam than HFR does.

I'm not here to berate individuals for playing the games that they want, but we are four months into 2023 and stories of bad PC ports outweigh the good ones. 

At this point I am asking myself if we are not rewarding studios for delivering poor quality products at full price, while those that do deliver and give extra care to the PC community simply do not see the fruits of their effort rewarded. Upon seeing this, why would any studio put more than the least amount of effort into their games?

Are we sending the wrong message? And how can we fix this?",1072,12pci08,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/12pci08/hifi_rush_is_the_most_solid_pc_port_of_2023_among/,311,2023-04-17 11:27:22,N/A,True,False,False,0.81,1072,0

I have to change my play style to enjoy modern AAA Games.,"I'm 35 years old and the way I normally would play games like Fallout or Grand Theft Auto would be to leave no stone unturned.  I'd grab all side quests and look in every home and cave and this for the most part was rewarding fun play.  However this style of play in modern games gets me so side tracked with little reward and very little fun
 Games like Assassin Creed Valhalla I got so burnt out from just becoming overwhelmed with side shit to do that isn't even fun.  So now I just stick to the main story in these big open world games, this way I can may actually finish one.

Palworld's success just shows how hungry people are for a good Pokemon game.,"&#x200B;

1. the game is buggy as fuck, it's indeed alpha.
2. it's literally a copy of a few games (being inspired is one thing, but literally making Zelda sounds and text fonts is an intentional joke. the game even mocks Zelda and quotes it in its trailer, as well as takes its aesthetics. everything else is Survival Ark-like. so this game is really just **Pokemon+Survival Ark+Zelda** \- and not in an ""inspired"" way but in a ""it's a copy haha"" way).
3. throughout the game it really feels like the devs are parodying something, like this entire thing is just for laughs,
4. the company behind this game has another early access game, called Craftopia - which is in early access for 3 years now. it is also just a blatant and shameless copy of other games. so they are just releasing more games without finishing their previous ones.

And yet, look at it. It broke records, it's kinda fun, tons of people play it, huge success.

I'm sure developers of other games are looking at this and literally get mad, after all the hard work they've put in their games that didn't scratch the surface of what this parody, almost a meme game reached in just a few days.

I think GameFreak needs to wake the fuck up.

People love good survival games, and people are thirsty for a good, refreshing, actually NEW Pokemon game for years. Even though the game literally feels like a copy of 3 other games, and a parody - the devs did the right thing by combining survival and Pokemon together. But were they expecting to be anywhere near the most played games of all time? I'm sure they weren't.

Edit: Some people say this game is nothing like Pokemon.

You literally have triangle Pokeballs. You throw them at Monsters that look a lot like Pokemon.  
You catch them. You level them up. I don't understand how can you claim there's **barely** any resemblance. There's plenty of resemblance, that's the main point of the game.",1028,19cqi88,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/19cqi88/palworlds_success_just_shows_how_hungry_people/,515,2024-01-22 07:50:51,N/A,True,False,False,0.76,1028,0

Level scaling rant,"Edit: Thank you all for your responses even if you disagree with the following. I'm glad this post sparked a conversation on this matter, not the first one around here and hopefully not the last one. /Edit

Honestly, prior to Diablo IV release, I'd never thought there are so many people who are pro level-scaling.

Some implementations of level scaling I hate with every bit of my soul since the Oblivion times, and I don't understand why people defend it so furiously.

""*Level scaling keeps content relevant as your foes are always a challenge for you""*

Being able to outlevel an area is the content itself. Mob that could one-shot you without taking a single scratch before, is not even an issue anymore. The realization that you were able to overcome some challenging enemies and they won't ever bother you anymore, is the content. You complete it and move forward. Want to feel the same challenge ever again on that particular location - run with a different character / increase world difficulty (whatever mechanic would it be), but don't make  enemies follow you in level.

Enemies are supposed to lose relevance at some point. It is the developers' responsibility to provide diverse and robust bestiary which has enemies for every stage of the play, so you always have some mobs which are relevant to you. Level scaling liberates developers from that by feeding  you the same mob over and over again.

*""Level scaling keeps the world immersive as every location stays relevant for you""*

Level  scaling kills the immersion, it provides just an illusion of a choice. You will be fighting different sprites. Scenery will change. But, that's it.

Locations are supposed to differ not in just appearance, but in the sense of security they provide to you, ranging from feeling complete domination to intense adrenaline high. Remember those wild robo-enemies out of nowhere in Wasteland 2, when you come across them for the first time, without much chance to defeat them, but being able to retreat, and come back later? What's the  point of having a vast enormous world where everything but the appearance is the same?

*""Without scaling there will be just a tiny relevant portion of the world that you will have to be doing over and over again""*

That's not an issue of scaling or lack thereof, that's the matter of endgame content. No one stops developers from creating various locations for top-levels only. No one stops developers from putting extremely difficult ""challenge rooms"" and other stuff even to the low-level locations, so you can come back much later and close them. Level scaling  is an easy and lazy method that liberates developers from working on  that late game content.

*""Level scaling doesn't make you weaker. The problem is that you have wrong gear/spec/skills/etc. I'm lv40 and I have been feeling stronger every single level. Also, you have many more different spells to work with""*

Level  scaling DOES make you weaker, simple as that. You level up, enemies  follow along. You replace your items and learn new skills not to become  stronger, but to compensate for becoming weaker from your leveling. To keep on par with the enemies. Had you been becoming stronger, level scaling wouldn't work as a technology, to begin with. Just think about  that for a moment, you are fighting on lv40 with the very same enemies as you had on lv7 making the exact same number of hits to kill them (maybe on some levels you'll feel the power surge from a lucky drop, but  that will go away real soon). And on lv90 that would be the very same  story.

*""Level scaling helps me play with my brother, who is 30 levels lower than me, and we both get the same amount of challenge""*

Scaling, indeed, helps playing with friends of different levels but comes with a high cost of a severe design flaw. Imagine investing 400 hours into your lv99 character and looking for low-level beginners to carry you in some fight with a boss you *cannot defeat anymore because you've grown too strong.* How does any of that make any sense.

*""People who are against level scaling are just junkies who crave that feeling of domination over weak enemies""*

People who play ARPGs, myself included, are junkies who crave dopamine influx from the feeling of accomplishment. That said, level scaling destroys that feeling.

*""The  game cannot anticipate what path will the player choose. Will they accomplish every single side quest or just rush the story""*

That's the best counter-point and a don't have a strong response here.

I  would consider that if the main quest becomes trivial after completing some side quests, that's a design flaw, and, again, scaling is just a lazy method to conceal it. You are supposed to wander over the world before continuing with the story, the next main quest step should account for that. If you rush the main quest line, it is normal that surrounding enemies begin to outlevel you, so you are expected to gain some skills around the world prior to continuing. If you play just for the story and don't care about challenge nor progression, lower the difficulty level then and complete the campaign.

On the other hand, if you did every single side quest and only then  started the main quest, granted, that might feel trivial. But Borderlands did well here by specifying recommended level for any given quest so you are aware that it is time to do that particular quest, otherwise, it will become way too easy for you in the nearest future.

*""Scaling works well if there is no down-scaling, so there is a minimum level still""*

It is much better, but only resolves some problems, not all of them.

Thanks for reading until this point. I needed to get it off my chest. I don't think that games without scaling are perfect and some scaling implementations are done well. I like scaling in Borderlands for the following reasons:

* Mobs have both min and max level
* A gap between min and max is  narrow (like 3-5 levels)
* Mobs' levels are determined at the moment of location initialization, which helps with the feeling of progression",943,1461hu3,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1461hu3/level_scaling_rant/,562,2023-06-10 14:19:56,FewAdhesiveness803,True,False,False,0.82,943,0

"One thing I've not seen talked about much with Enshrouded, is that it uses it's own Engine. Not Unreal, Unity, or Godot.","I thought it was UE4 or 5 with Lumen with how good it looks. I never bothered to google and had been telling people it was UE. Because it's graphically comparable to UE5 with Lumen.

But then if you go to their website, it's a completely custom engine they made. Voxel based - what I found astounding is a small indie dev team made an engine comparable to UE and not many are talking about that. It supports all the latest upscaling techs too. 

Performance seems moderate, not fantastic; but not awful either.  It's also Early Access.

Regardless of how you feel about the game itself, I think it's great to see a game that looks as good as Enshrouded does using it's own engine and not the big 3.   There are lots of indie games with custom 2D engines or whatever, but nothing complex like this.

Enshrouded looks really good and the voxel based destruction is solid.

This trend of buggy and unoptimized PC game sequels is really annoying.,"* Total War Warhammer 3
* Darktide
* Kerbal Space Program 2
* Cities Skylines 2

When some random AAA game makes a bad PC port at least you understand that they are prioritizing consoles and they don't care about PC (not that this is an excuse). But it baffles me how companies that are making games primarily for a PC audience, that  should understand how optimization is important and everything, still manage to release their games in a sorry state. They had a good name in the PC community, they had many thousands of players eager to play and they end up disappointing everyone just because they refuse to delay the game and fix it. 

Eventually the games get better after months or years of patching, but by that point many players just stop playing and never look back.

I find it horrible that CD project red is ditching their in house engine for UE5,"I understand that having an in house engine incurs an additional cost when it comes to game development, since you also have to spend development funds on maintaining and expanding the engine to keep up with modern demands, it also increases the on boarding time for developers, since if the engine is only used inhouse, developers wont have experience with it.

That said, I dread the future where every PC game is made on UE. I can deal with the horrible TAA or general bad optimization often present in UE games, or even that its made by epic. The one thing I detest though is stutters, from the recent shader compilation issues plaguing UE games to that all so famous and ancient asset loading stutter that has been present in UE games since who knows how long.

I've never had asset streaming stutters (at least not as severally) in games made with cryengine, RE engine, RED engine, capcom old ass framework engine used in MHW, ID tech, source and void engine, I could probs go through a list of games and list their engines, but I'll stop here. This is an issue that I've experienced across multiple machines.

The only other engine that manages to be as bad or worse from my experience is Unity. I wish I had a third engine, cause then I could call them the unholy trinity.

The worse part is, I cant escape UE. Just recently I bought ready or not to play with my friends. Guess what, its made with UE 4, I havent tested the game, but I'm going in expecting it to suffer from asset stutters. I was interested in lies of P, its also made with UE. Senua's Saga, being made with UE, same probs with Ghostrunner 2 and a few other games I'm interested in.

CD project reds engine is impressive, especially after they fixed cyberpunk 2077. I understand that they want to remove the cost of having to maintain their own engine and maybe broaden the scope of available developers  with experience, but I just dont agree with the move to UE.",815,16xtcnb,pcgaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/16xtcnb/i_find_it_horrible_that_cd_project_red_is/,952,2023-10-02 10:46:52,N/A,True,False,False,0.69,815,0

"Just days after release, Paradox writes off entire cost of The Lamplighter's League ($30m) as a loss after gutting developer studio months prior","According to a press release dated 10.10.2023 ([click](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-writes-down-msek-171-of-capitalized-development-cost-for-the-lamplighters-league)), just 7 days after the game released:

>Paradox Interactive has today decided to write down capitalized development costs for the game The Lamplighters League, in addition to the regular degressive amortization done during the game’s first three months. Overall, this will result in that all of the game’s capitalized development costs of MSEK 320 will be recognized as costs in the fourth quarter of 2023. The game’s impact on profit before tax for the fourth quarter is estimated to MSEK -248. The write-down stems from a revised sales forecast, which was established after the game’s release.

>“The Lamplighters League is a fun game with many strengths. Even though we see cautiously positive player numbers in subscription services, the commercial reception has been too weak, which is frankly a big disappointment. Game projects are by their nature always risky, but at the end of the day we haven’t performed at the level we should. It is painful but makes us more eager to roll up our sleeves and do better,” says Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive.

Furthermore, apparently Paradox gutted the studio back in July, laying of 80% of the workforce ([click](https://www.resetera.com/threads/paradox-writes-down-entire-cost-of-the-lamplighters-league-320m-sek-citing-weak-commercial-success-%E2%80%9Ccautiously-positive%E2%80%9D-subscription-players.773480/post-113276105)]

You can use Windows Live Captions on games with missing subtitles feature,"Microsoft recently added Live Caption feature to Windows 11, which provide automatic transcription to videos. But surprisingly, it works not only on browser but for games too.

I tried it recently to see if I could use it to add subtitles to Assassin’s Creed, a game that has notoriously missing in-game subtitles, and it works. Not perfect though, because I couldn’t use it with full screen, only in window modes.  There’s also very slight delay as the tool needs time to transcribe but its not a very big deal. In addition as Live Captions uses speech technology, you can’t have video or music running in the background, and it might mistranscribe especially if the audio isn’t very clear (eg background NPC chatters or thick accent). And lastly only US English is supported. Hopefully more language support (and even translation) will come in the future.

For deaf players or people who can’t understand the dialogue due to the accent, I highly recommend you to give it a try. 

To turn on Live Captions, press Windows + Ctrl + L.

Why does 1080p look so blurry in most modern games?,"I've recently gotten back to playing Titanfall 2 and was in awe at how sharp and clear the game looked on my run of the mil 1080p monitor, however when I play the new CoD MWII game, everything just looks blurry and awful it's almost as if the game runs at 480p and someone conveniently smeared Vaseline onto my eyes.

Valve has blocked ability to access or download de_voyna from Russian IP addresses in Workshop,"Copied from: https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/13wjkis/valve_has_blocked_ability_to_access_or_download/

> [de_voyna](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2969831273) is map published by Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat.

> At first look it looks like a normal defusal map, but it contains a hidden room which shows uncensored information about the war in Ukraine. 3kliksphilip made video about it when it was released; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLcpNHnh_zo

> Now Helsingin Sanomat has learned that Russian IP addresses cannot no longer see the map in Workshop, and they cant access it or download it. Meaning that Valve has blocked access to it from Russian IP addresses. 

> HS asked Valve for comments, but at least at the time of writing this, Valve are yet to answer.
